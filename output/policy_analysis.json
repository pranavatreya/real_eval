        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npi0_fast_droid is an aggressive, high-tempo manipulation policy that attempts a complete action plan in most episodes.  It typically moves quickly to the vicinity of the goal object, executes a firm closed-gripper grasp, and then performs a direct transport to the target receptacle or area.  When the scene is simple and the goal is a single pick-and-place, the policy is reliable; it accumulated more wins than losses overall.  However, the controller shows limited fine control, brittle perception for similarly-colored distractors, and little high-level planning.  As soon as a task requires multi-step reasoning (open \u2192 insert \u2192 close, stacking, pouring cleanly, leaving an item held upright, etc.) the success rate drops sharply and the robot often stops after a partial solution or manipulates the wrong object.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\nOverall record across the 97 evaluated episodes:  \nWins = 53, Losses = 30, Ties = 14 (\u2248 55 % win rate).  \n\nTypical head-to-head behaviour  \n\u2022 Outperforms peers on single-object pick-and-place (e.g. pineapple-to-bowl <ref>7a84d536-013e-4ad0-9c5d-ea3be1e9474c</ref>, stapler-to-paper <ref>bb75fd74-e346-46b9-90e4-95339133283a</ref>, mouse-to-cloth <ref>a5247f6a-461d-4388-b35d-ed65a1e7dfc6</ref>).  \n\u2022 Comparable on \u201ceasy but cluttered\u201d scenes; many ties arose when both policies grabbed the right object but mis-placed it (tape-on-paper <ref>c63d7c98-cf4b-4ce2-99a6-cae8eab4a766</ref>, spoon-in-rack <ref>6dbe79b9-2d64-4e7c-a9a1-92019c1b9336</ref>).  \n\u2022 Frequently underperforms on precision stacking or multi-stage tasks (blocks <ref>7b034400-d225-4d3d-be8e-462f6fcb83d0</ref>, cups-on-cups <ref>f6bd95dd-7c4f-4623-8f18-bb88e1ae4c8d</ref>, bowls stacking <ref>33564d71-15cb-4032-a29b-d4d6c4225ccc</ref>).  \n\u2022 Suffers more from object-confusion than competitors; losses often stem from selecting the wrong colour/type (black-bowl tape <ref>84319d8a-6873-470d-b23f-aeb4d6107520</ref>, green marker vs. purple marker <ref>fcd79a4d-50c9-4342-aa19-93881eb68264</ref>).  \n\u2022 Handles typo/negation instructions a bit better than peers (\u201cnon-read object\u201d) and won those match-ups <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>.  \n\u2022 In low-light scenes performance degrades but still occasionally beats the baseline (cup right-side-up under dim light <ref>d2b59c33-3a4e-489b-bb20-9fbe5795e1bd</ref>).  \nKey head-to-head insights  \n\u2013 Fast retries allow eventual success where the rival froze (e.g. pineapple pick, second attempt succeeds <ref>7a84d536-013e-4ad0-9c5d-ea3be1e9474c</ref>).  \n\u2013 Competitor typically wins when delicate alignment is required (stacking blue blocks <ref>7b034400-d225-4d3d-be8e-462f6fcb83d0</ref>).  \n\u2013 Both policies often fail together on ambiguous colour instructions; ties dominated such cases (green marker -> purple picked by both <ref>e3e6aed4-d623-44f6-887d-cff04559abdf</ref>).  \n\u2013 pi0_fast_droid can salvage partially correct grasps better than peers (paper into shredder after two tries <ref>998d501d-1b19-451d-8cd4-bcce6807ec20</ref>).  \n\u2013 Loses when task demands leaving object in a precise state after placement (pouring coffee, Portafilter insertion <ref>47312494-7185-40a8-9162-9a5812fc9b21</ref>).  \n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Decisive, short reaction time; often reaches the goal object within seconds (<ref>7a84d536-013e-4ad0-9c5d-ea3be1e9474c</ref>, <ref>f33bc806-72ad-4ffc-88dc-000e6cee5c3c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Robust basic grasping of varied shapes (paper sheet <ref>998d501d-1b19-451d-8cd4-bcce6807ec20</ref>, wired mouse <ref>a5247f6a-461d-4388-b35d-ed65a1e7dfc6</ref>, toothpaste tube <ref>fd94c503-9938-4d11-a0cc-059b825ae7aa</ref>).  \n\u2022 Handles single-step colour / category pick-and-place better than opponent (red cube from bowl <ref>6d7586e4-3bab-4ff3-a8ad-ecdb25e83300</ref>, blue square to blue bowl <ref>b8b4ce87-d34f-4b63-9966-6e8bbe9d8570</ref>).  \n\u2022 Recovers from initial failure by re-grasping without freezing (pineapple second grasp <ref>7a84d536-013e-4ad0-9c5d-ea3be1e9474c</ref>, paper shredding second grip <ref>998d501d-1b19-451d-8cd4-bcce6807ec20</ref>).  \n\u2022 Tolerant to spelling mistakes / negations: succeeded with \u201cnon-read object\u201d and \u201chold up object that is not RED\u201d tasks <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>, <ref>b6b4e19d-5b3d-4d20-8636-e0ce160eefae</ref>.  \n\u2022 Maintains performance in moderate clutter (red bottle among markers <ref>8d7315ac-400b-4de0-81bb-6e2697d06000</ref>).  \n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Frequent object confusion when distractors share colour/shape (picks stapler instead of tape <ref>84319d8a-6873-470d-b23f-aeb4d6107520</ref>, grabs towel instead of tape <ref>c850017f-bd6d-4cc5-9ab0-2a7a7af47949</ref>).  \n\u2022 Poor fine alignment: drops stack or mis-places item (blue blocks fell <ref>7b034400-d225-4d3d-be8e-462f6fcb83d0</ref>, cube dropped early <ref>ac0ea231-970e-4385-8c79-721106e792aa</ref>).  \n\u2022 Limited multi-step planning; often completes only first subtasks (moves one object repeatedly on orange tile <ref>107cb4bf-2e5a-46e1-84c1-f45467de56e6</ref>, stops after first item in \u201cplace all items\u201d <ref>08d3d301-7027-418b-9fe7-e11b1a23c624</ref>).  \n\u2022 Susceptible to low-light scenes; mis-grasp or time out (fork-to-right-of-plate lost <ref>07fbba6f-3409-48b5-964a-614b72cc0cac</ref>, food-on-plate lost <ref>8c045222-b8fd-4d1d-ae84-56caffd221d8</ref>).  \n\u2022 Rare but critical instruction violations (moved when told \u201cdo absolutely nothing\u201d <ref>25c0a175-ad1c-468e-b55e-e1029f26d94e</ref>).  \n\u2022 Freezing mid-episode after partial success (marker-in-jar repeated three times and stalled <ref>1bd6a7c9-9ee5-4916-8483-01dd32eb93bc</ref>).  \n\n5. Instruction Following  \nThe policy reliably handles simple, imperative sentences (\u201cpick up X and put in Y\u201d) and even survives mild typos (\u201cnon-read\u201d task).  It struggles with:  \n\u2022 Negated or relational phrases involving multiple references\u2014picked wrong colour marker twice (<ref>fcd79a4d-50c9-4342-aa19-93881eb68264</ref>, <ref>e3e6aed4-d623-44f6-887d-cff04559abdf</ref>).  \n\u2022 Multi-clause goals: only executed half of \u201ctake block out and close the box\u201d <ref>eedec128-c537-4054-9168-d34ad3905e1c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Passive commands (\u201cdo absolutely nothing\u201d) \u2013 moved anyway <ref>25c0a175-ad1c-468e-b55e-e1029f26d94e</ref>.  \nOverall, language understanding is adequate for single-verb tasks but insufficient for sequencing or nuanced spatial relations.\n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning strengths: identifies nearest open receptacle and plans straight-line paths (paper to floor shredder slot <ref>998d501d-1b19-451d-8cd4-bcce6807ec20</ref>).  Weaknesses: fails to reason about stack stability (blue-on-green cups <ref>f6bd95dd-7c4f-4623-8f18-bb88e1ae4c8d</ref>), or about occluded objects (cannot find frog not visible in wrist cam <ref>6317140c-7d54-470e-9bfc-4b530f484f67</ref>).  Text reasoning deficits show up when tasks contain ordered steps or implicit conditions (cloth-then-box drape <ref>8b205c5a-e5d3-4a46-a79f-937780babf4b</ref>).  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasping: firm parallel-jaw closure grasps most rigid items successfully (battery, spoon, markers).  \n\u2022 Placing: good drop-in accuracy for large containers (bowls, bins) but poor for small targets\u2014tape thrown short of black bowl <ref>84319d8a-6873-470d-b23f-aeb4d6107520</ref>.  \n\u2022 Stacking / vertical alignment: inconsistent (blocks <ref>7b034400-d225-4d3d-be8e-462f6fcb83d0</ref>, bowls <ref>33564d71-15cb-4032-a29b-d4d6c4225ccc</ref>).  \n\u2022 Insertion tasks needing orientation (portafilter into grinder <ref>47312494-7185-40a8-9162-9a5812fc9b21</ref>, scissors from holder <ref>48cd6a3a-f5f9-4f0f-a474-61c0bc288863</ref>) usually fail.  \n\u2022 Pouring / rotating: partial success but spills (nuts half on plate <ref>7f924418-7d2a-43ba-a3d6-024065acbc9a</ref>), unable to twist bottle cap <ref>f845aa64-4376-485c-b58a-ca33718ea83a</ref>.  \n\u2022 Cloth/towel handling: can pick edge but rarely completes full fold neatly (<ref>dab90390-74ef-428a-8001-1742cca1e5f0</ref>, <ref>6e73b31f-eef2-4545-8ee1-1e3cb143437b</ref>).  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \n\u2022 Handles moderate clutter and multiple colours (won with 10+ items on bench in \u201ccup to basket\u201d <ref>28f37798-fb92-46ee-b137-08d1125412ae</ref>).  \n\u2022 Performance degrades under low illumination, leading to hesitation or mis-grasp (<ref>07fbba6f-3409-48b5-964a-614b72cc0cac</ref>, <ref>8c045222-b8fd-4d1d-ae84-56caffd221d8</ref>).  \n\u2022 Camera occlusion by gripper often causes search failure (frog tasks <ref>6317140c-7d54-470e-9bfc-4b530f484f67</ref>).  \n\u2022 Survives minor wording noise (typos, capitalisation) but sensitive to colour ambiguity when similar hues exist.  \n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Grabs wrong but similarly-coloured object (stapler vs. tape <ref>84319d8a-6873-470d-b23f-aeb4d6107520</ref>, towel vs. tape <ref>c850017f-bd6d-4cc5-9ab0-2a7a7af47949</ref>).  \n\u2022 Drops item short / outside container (cloth at edge of bowl <ref>2a6b9acf-1e66-4312-9d23-bfa0824337fe</ref>).  \n\u2022 Stops after first step of multi-item tasks (<ref>08d3d301-7027-418b-9fe7-e11b1a23c624</ref>, <ref>107cb4bf-2e5a-46e1-84c1-f45467de56e6</ref>).  \n\u2022 Freezes for long periods, exhausting clock (<ref>425ee9b1-54ad-4659-97b3-5ae9ea088205</ref>, <ref>56a06dda-819f-4418-8f64-28ef0571dc23</ref>).  \n\u2022 Over-aggressive approach leads to collisions or pushing target away (scissors container bump <ref>48cd6a3a-f5f9-4f0f-a474-61c0bc288863</ref>).  \n\u2022 Cannot achieve required orientation change \u2013 fails to rotate mug upside down despite multiple grasps (<ref>9b70548e-b1c6-4c3d-8364-fba34a77949b</ref>).  \n\nThis analysis suggests that pi0_fast_droid is a strong baseline for quick, single-step pick-and-place tasks in reasonably lit, uncluttered scenes, but additional perception filtering, trajectory refinement, and high-level planning are needed for complex, multi-object, or precision manipulation assignments.",
        "summary": "- Comparative Performance: ~55 % win rate; strong on single-object pick-and-place, parity on cluttered \u201ceasy\u201d scenes, clearly worse on precision stacking or multi-stage tasks; more prone to object-selection errors than peers but slightly better with typo/negation instructions; speed and rapid retries yield some salvage wins, yet delicate alignment and low-light conditions tilt losses.  \n\n- Strengths: Very fast reaction and approach, reliable closed-gripper grasps across varied shapes, good recovery via re-grasping, consistent success on one-step colour/category goals, tolerant to moderate clutter and minor language noise.  \n\n- Weaknesses: Frequent confusion among similar objects, poor fine alignment and stacking, limited multi-step planning, performance drop in low light, occasional instruction violations or mid-episode freezes.  \n\n- Instruction Following: Executes simple imperative sentences and survives minor typos, but misinterprets negated/relational phrases, truncates multi-clause goals, and even disobeys \u201cdo nothing\u201d commands; adequate for single-verb tasks, inadequate for nuanced sequencing or spatial relations.  \n\n- Reasoning: Can identify obvious receptacles and plan direct paths, yet lacks reasoning about stability, occlusions, or ordered dependencies; struggles with implicit conditions and multi-step logical chains.  \n\n- Manipulation Skills: Firm, reliable grasps; good placement into large containers; weak accuracy for small targets, inconsistent stacking, frequent failures on orientation-dependent insertion, pouring, twisting, or cloth folding.  \n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Maintains performance in moderate clutter and wording noise, but degrades with low illumination, gripper-camera occlusions, and colour ambiguity; still occasionally outperforms baseline despite these stresses.  \n\n- Common Failure Modes: Picks wrong similarly coloured object, drops items short of receptacle, halts after first sub-task, freezes and times out, collides during aggressive moves, or cannot achieve required orientation changes.",

The top-down view provides a clear perspective of the immediate area in front of the robot, while the side view gives additional context about the height and positioning of objects.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, clearly illuminating the workspace and objects. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder observation or task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"do absolutely nothing. do not move\" is clear and unambiguous. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The instruction explicitly states that the robot should remain stationary and perform no actions.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black perforated table surface with a cardboard box and some colored objects stacked on top of it. There is also a small object placed separately on the table. The workspace is relatively uncluttered, and the objects are neatly arranged and clearly visible. There are no significant distractors or unnecessary clutter that would interfere with the robot's ability to complete the task of doing nothing.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears very easy. Given the clarity of the instruction (\"do absolutely nothing. do not move\") and the simplicity of the scene setup, the robot does not need to perform any manipulation or movement. The objects' placement and visibility do not affect the difficulty, as the robot is explicitly instructed to remain stationary.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_fast_droid was Policy B\nResult: pi0_fast_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: both policies completely failed to adhere to my instructions.",

There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the spoon in the dish rack\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the object to manipulate (spoon) and the target location (dish rack), leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene setup includes a table with several objects: a spoon, a dish rack, a bowl, a carrot-shaped object, cans, a cup, and a red plate. Although multiple objects are present, the spoon and dish rack are clearly visible and not obstructed. The spoon is placed flat on the table, easily accessible, and the dish rack is positioned clearly at one side of the table. The additional objects could serve as distractors, but they are spaced apart enough to minimize interference with the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The spoon is clearly visible, lying flat on the table, and the dish rack is open and easily accessible. The robot should be able to grasp the spoon without difficulty, as there are no immediate obstacles or challenging orientations. The presence of distractors slightly increases complexity, but overall, the task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_fast_droid was Policy B\nResult: pi0_fast_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: They both pick up the wrong object",

            "Session ID: bb75fd74-e346-46b9-90e4-95339133283a\nTask: put the red stapler on the sheet of paper\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include two third-person views from the left and right cameras and one top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. The third-person views clearly show the overall environment, the position of the stapler, and the sheet of paper. The top-down view provides a close-up and clear perspective of the stapler and paper, making it easy to identify their relative positions and orientations. Overall, the camera angles are sufficient and provide clear visibility of the objects and environment necessary for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is bright and evenly distributed, providing good visibility of the objects and workspace. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the red stapler on the sheet of paper\" is clear and straightforward. However, there is a discrepancy in the description, as the stapler visible in the images appears gray and black rather than red. This color mismatch introduces ambiguity and could potentially confuse the robot or evaluator.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a countertop workspace with several objects present. The primary objects relevant to the task are the stapler and the sheet of paper, both clearly visible and accessible. However, there are multiple distractor objects, including a tape roll, orange container, cables, and other miscellaneous items, which could potentially interfere with the robot's manipulation. The stapler is placed close to the paper, oriented in a way that should be easy to grasp and move. The paper is flat and unobstructed, providing a clear target area for placing the stapler.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The clear visibility, good lighting, and straightforward nature of the task (placing one object onto another) simplify the manipulation. However, the presence of distractor objects and the color discrepancy in the task description (red stapler vs. gray stapler) could introduce confusion or errors.

        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npaligemma_fast_droid is an aggressive, largely reactive manipulation policy that favors quick, straight-line motions and coarse grasps.  In head-to-head play it finishes just under half of all episodes in first place (52 wins, 36 losses, 17 ties across 105 evaluated tasks), showing solid competence on single\u2013step pick-and-place or \u201ctouch\u201d tasks, even under dim lighting or with modest clutter.  However, the policy shows clear limitations with multi-step sequences, subtler language constraints, delicate rotations, and color- or category-based selection.  It often grasps confidently but mis-classifies targets or fails to complete a final sub-action, suggesting that its perception\u2013to\u2013action loop is tuned for speed more than deliberation or fine control.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\nOverall statistics  \nWins = 52, Losses = 36, Ties = 17  (49.5 % / 34.3 % / 16.2 %)\n\nPerformance patterns  \n\u2022 Dominates simple single-object pick, touch, or knock tasks (e.g., picked up the red box while the rival froze <ref>214e965c-cfe4-418b-8f88-41ee94939fe4</ref>, touched the correct book first-try <ref>aed7d0aa-0bdb-474f-9bee-4aec94139c74</ref>).  \n\u2022 Falls behind on color-set or \u201call items\u201d grouping tasks where the rival eventually finds the correct subset (lost \u201call red items\u201d <ref>00d2b265-f7fd-409d-8b09-3112db0046d2</ref>, \u201cnon-red object\u201d <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Beats rivals on many drawer/door failures by simply moving when the opponent freezes (won \u201copen drawer\u201d despite collision <ref>3f8a023f-ad3c-4194-bfe2-eeffd92bb6ab</ref>).  \n\u2022 Underperforms on rotation/orientation tasks\u2014lost both kettle and bread 90\u00b0 rotations while rival at least attempted correct orientation <ref>ed20036f-b36a-4a7a-8eb8-3f1ba55432a2</ref>, <ref>c3d4f82d-cf43-4d6c-83df-70405087178a</ref>.  \n\u2022 Negative-constraint language trips it up as much as competitors (both policies touched the forbidden spoon <ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>).  \n\u2022 Often wins timed races where speed matters even if precision is imperfect (threw tape toward bowl and still beat slower rival <ref>84319d8a-6873-470d-b23f-aeb4d6107520</ref>).  \n\u2022 Ties frequently occur when both teams mis-interpret a subtle detail (both placed tape wrong color bowl <ref>c076f615-d098-4733-9711-a7dc1dc8e064</ref>; both failed to knock cup fully off <ref>96c24f50-7d22-42c3-8ace-16749aa99e2c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Multi-stage tasks (open drawer \u2192 move carrot, cups \u2192 ball) tend to go to the rival or end in stalemate (lost \u201cpick cups then ball\u201d <ref>739165f0-2b54-4776-91b8-1530a4148feb</ref>).  \n\nKey insights  \n\u2013 The policy\u2019s win-rate jumps above 70 % on \u201cpick-and-place one object into container\u201d variants but drops below 40 % on multi-object grouping or color-filter tasks.  \n\u2013 Speed and willingness to act yield many \u201cdefault\u201d wins when the competitor freezes (<ref>379e00ab-f6a8-4a48-8d0b-e04378d95a74</ref>, <ref>02fab778-79b2-4a64-a325-91d1e21dc1df</ref>).  \n\u2013 Rough grasp planning beats indecision but loses to rivals with finer semantic perception (e.g., chose yellow duck instead of white brick <ref>ecc071f2-5dfe-48b4-83b1-c0623826803b</ref>).  \n\u2013 Frequent mis-classification of color or \u201cdifferent\u201d object explains a sizeable share of losses (purple vs orange confusion <ref>c076f615-d098-4733-9711-a7dc1dc8e064</ref>, wrong non-red pick <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>).  \n\u2013 Releases are often delayed or omitted; rivals that place and let go win precision challenges (lid on pot mis-aligned but released, rival better alignment yet no release <ref>57e27cdb-ddd6-48fc-a05d-4fcbd519bfb7</ref>).  \n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Quick, decisive single-object grasping\u2014immediately lifted red tape while the opponent was idle <ref>8bb5fa58-3a5d-4416-af38-9f9c47189680</ref>.  \n\u2022 Resilient to low-light scenes; still succeeded in dim red-box pick-up <ref>214e965c-cfe4-418b-8f88-41ee94939fe4</ref>.  \n\u2022 Handles simple insert/stack motions smoothly (banana into bottle with tilt correction <ref>8c55a6ce-fee6-42fe-bfd2-1c63f6b3fa8d</ref>; pineapple into partially-seen bowl <ref>5b10c3c3-1a7d-4716-9e06-1d28e64cedfc</ref>).  \n\u2022 Shows purposeful mid-course correction when first attempt slips, e.g., re-grasp book corner accurately <ref>13e10649-3ae9-45e8-995b-42a1cb27280c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Tends to exploit available time instead of freezing\u2014continued searching and eventually removed towel paper pieces while rival stayed inert <ref>0f4d8f93-75d6-4596-98ee-00f806f25888</ref>.  \n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Color semantics & filtering errors: chose red block instead of non-red <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>, mis-identified purple object <ref>c076f615-d098-4733-9711-a7dc1dc8e064</ref>, failed \u201call red items\u201d grouping <ref>00d2b265-f7fd-409d-8b09-3112db0046d2</ref>.  \n\u2022 Rotation and orientation tasks often lost (kettle 90\u00b0 <ref>ed20036f-b36a-4a7a-8eb8-3f1ba55432a2</ref>, bread rotation <ref>c3d4f82d-cf43-4d6c-83df-70405087178a</ref>).  \n\u2022 Multi-step sequencing inconsistencies\u2014did not finish cup-ball sequence <ref>739165f0-2b54-4776-91b8-1530a4148feb</ref>; mishandled carrot-drawer flow <ref>e7ec66ae-95c0-4601-b044-a9313914dfca</ref>.  \n\u2022 Ignores explicit negations: touched forbidden spoon despite strong instruction <ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>.  \n\u2022 Release failures\u2014kept lid too long (<ref>57e27cdb-ddd6-48fc-a05d-4fcbd519bfb7</ref>), never dropped tape into bowl securely (<ref>84319d8a-6873-470d-b23f-aeb4d6107520</ref>).  \n\u2022 Occasional object confusion in clutter, e.g., grabbed yellow duck instead of white brick <ref>ecc071f2-5dfe-48b4-83b1-c0623826803b</ref>.  \n\n5. Instruction Following  \nThe policy parses straightforward imperatives reliably (\u201cpick up\u201d, \u201ctouch\u201d, \u201cput X in Y\u201d) but struggles with:  \n\u2022 Negated constraints (\u201cdo not touch the spoon\u201d)\u2014violated in <ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>.  \n\u2022 Relational qualifiers (\u201cnon-red object\u201d, \u201cdifferent object among three\u201d)\u2014partially successful but often wrong selection <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>, <ref>4f26d14f-b4a7-437d-aba5-b5d9a735393a</ref>.  \n\u2022 Multi-clause or ordered commands (\u201ctouch a book then the bear\u201d)\u2014started sequence but rarely finished second step <ref>4cdf7321-f9ad-4a9d-8529-cf7cc08b6f20</ref>.  \n\u2022 Verb nuances (\u201cdust off\u201d, \u201cdrape\u201d) are interpreted roughly; sometimes succeeds by chance but lacks consistent semantic grounding (<ref>0f4d8f93-75d6-4596-98ee-00f806f25888</ref>, <ref>2bfd8160-596a-4ea8-8aab-61995be0f37b</ref>).  \nTypos or informal language generally tolerated (success on \u201cpalce it in the bowl\u201d <ref>4f26d14f-b4a7-437d-aba5-b5d9a735393a</ref>).\n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning strength: selects reachable path quickly, avoids most obstacles (e.g., maneuvered around clutter to hang ring on pole <ref>78c9a5c6-b24e-4ec5-a84d-9efa31c9f0a9</ref>).  \nDeficits:  \n\u2022 Poor color categorization reasoning (purple/orange confusion <ref>c076f615-d098-4733-9711-a7dc1dc8e064</ref>).  \n\u2022 Limited conditional or multi-object planning\u2014did not first \u201copen drawer\u201d before carrot transfer <ref>e7ec66ae-95c0-4601-b044-a9313914dfca</ref>.  \n\u2022 Reasoning under occlusion shallow; fails shelf-search tasks (plant retrieval lost <ref>d49dcce7-3510-482d-ba06-0cbccb0b1d79</ref>).  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasps: firm, decisive grasps on regular objects (tape roll, cups, blocks).  \n\u2022 Trajectories: generally straight and fast; smoother than rival in many wins (<ref>852444f5-77f0-4dc7-b10c-f7beb712715d</ref>).  \n\u2022 In-place motions: basic pushing/knocking effective (cup off table <ref>379e00ab-f6a8-4a48-8d0b-e04378d95a74</ref>).  \n\u2022 Placement: good at dropping into wide containers but precision falters\u2014often lands near target (tape \u201cthrown\u201d at bowl <ref>84319d8a-6873-470d-b23f-aeb4d6107520</ref>).  \n\u2022 Rotation/insertion: weak (kettle, bread, screwdriver into bag lost <ref>fda392f6-41ed-4146-bb32-dcf771c518ae</ref>).  \n\u2022 Recovery: occasionally re-grips successfully (banana tilt <ref>8c55a6ce-fee6-42fe-bfd2-1c63f6b3fa8d</ref>).  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \n\u2022 Handles poor lighting better than rival in several episodes (<ref>214e965c-cfe4-418b-8f88-41ee94939fe4</ref>, <ref>2e1d844d-9167-4219-92e8-418b3f464b84</ref>).  \n\u2022 Performs consistently on cluttered office/kitchen tables, though shelves or vertical search tasks degrade performance (<ref>d49dcce7-3510-482d-ba06-0cbccb0b1d79</ref>).  \n\u2022 Adapts to table-height variations (blue towel to sink success <ref>08651de3-d44b-4b5c-b89b-5d40468b60c7</ref>).  \n\u2022 Sensitive to occlusion from its own gripper\u2014misses drawer handles and small objects hidden under wrist camera (<ref>3f8a023f-ad3c-4194-bfe2-eeffd92bb6ab</ref>).  \n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Color / category mis-identification (purple vs orange, non-red item).  \n\u2022 Neglecting second step in multi-stage or ordered tasks.  \n\u2022 Never releasing after placement (lid on pot, blocks).  \n\u2022 Freezing midway or repetitive flailing when target lost (<ref>83cf3ea3-3c5c-4189-9b73-e083c5bc98d9</ref>).  \n\u2022 Overshoot collisions with drawers or cabinets (<ref>e7ec66ae-95c0-4601-b044-a9313914dfca</ref>).  \n\u2022 Object dropped outside container due to too-high release (<ref>84319d8a-6873-470d-b23f-aeb4d6107520</ref>).  \n\nOverall, paligemma_fast_droid is a fast, generally reliable policy for simple pick-and-place manipulation, outperforming peers when tasks are short and perception unambiguous, but it lags on nuanced semantic understanding, multi-step reasoning, and fine motor precision.",
        "summary": "- Comparative Performance: ~50 % win rate overall; excels at single-object pick, touch, knock tasks; >70 % success on one-step place-in-container; <40 % on multi-object grouping, color filter, orientation or rotation; speed yields many wins when rival stalls, but semantic mis-classification and missed sub-actions drive most losses and ties.  \n\n- Strengths: Fast, decisive grasps; solid under dim lighting and moderate clutter; smooth straight-line trajectories for pick-and-place or simple insert/stack; willing to re-grasp or keep searching instead of freezing; often exploits idle opponents.  \n\n- Weaknesses: Frequent color/semantic selection errors; poor rotation and precise orientation; inconsistent multi-step sequencing; ignores explicit negations; delays or omits releases; occasional object confusion in dense scenes.  \n\n- Instruction Following: Reliable on direct \u201cpick / touch / put X in Y\u201d; falters on negated constraints, relational qualifiers, multi-clause or ordered commands, and subtle verb nuances; tolerates typos or informal wording.  \n\n- Reasoning: Quickly chooses reachable paths and avoids obstacles; limited color reasoning, conditional planning, and under-occlusion search; struggles to chain prerequisite actions (e.g., open drawer before move).  \n\n- Manipulation Skills: Firm grasps, fast smooth paths, effective pushes; good gross placement into large containers but coarse drop accuracy; weak rotation, insertion, delicate alignment; occasional successful re-grip recovery.  \n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Performs well in low light, clutter, and varying table heights; degrades on shelf/vertical retrieval and heavy occlusion; wrist-camera self-occlusion hides small handles or items.  \n\n- Common Failure Modes: Color/category mis-ID, skipped second step in sequences, failure to release after placement, mid-task freezing or flailing, drawer/cabinet collision overshoot, dropping objects outside target due to high release.",

            "Session ID: 214e965c-cfe4-418b-8f88-41ee94939fe4\nTask: pick up the red box\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a third-person view and a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. The third-person view shows the red box clearly placed on the table, providing a good perspective of the object's location and orientation. The top-down view from the wrist camera also clearly shows the red box, although the angle is slightly tilted, it still provides sufficient information for the robot to approach and grasp the box.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is insufficient and dim, creating shadows and dark areas that reduce visibility. The red box is still identifiable, but the poor lighting conditions could potentially make the task more challenging, especially for precise manipulation or accurate depth perception.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up the red box\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There is no ambiguity regarding the object to be manipulated, as the red box is clearly distinguishable from other objects in the scene.\n\nScene: The scene setup is relatively simple, with minimal clutter. The red box is placed on a dark table surface, clearly separated from other objects. There is a cardboard box and a small stack of papers or cards on the table, but these objects are distant enough from the red box to avoid interference. The red box is oriented upright and easily accessible, making it straightforward for the robot to approach and grasp.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The simplicity of the scene, clear task description, and straightforward placement of the red box make the task relatively easy. However, the poor lighting conditions introduce some difficulty, potentially affecting the robot's visual perception and precision during grasping. Overall, the task should be manageable, provided the robot can adequately handle the dim lighting conditions.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_fast_droid won\nEvaluation notes: policy A did not do anything -- just froze. policy B actually picked up the red box at its third attempt.",

The third-person view clearly shows the green frog placed on top of the brown box, providing a good perspective of the task environment. The top-down view from the wrist camera also clearly shows the box, but the green frog is not clearly visible from this angle, potentially making it slightly harder for the robot to precisely locate the frog.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is sufficient and evenly distributed, clearly illuminating the box, frog, and surrounding area. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"just knock off the green frog off the brown box and nothing else\" is clear and understandable. However, the phrasing could be slightly improved grammatically by removing the redundant \"off\" after \"frog\" (\"just knock the green frog off the brown box and nothing else\"). The lowercase letters do not affect the clarity of the task.\n\nScene: The scene is simple and uncluttered, consisting primarily of a brown cardboard box with a green frog placed on top. There is a small stuffed animal next to the frog, which could potentially act as a distractor or obstacle. The box is clearly visible and centrally placed, and the frog is positioned on top, making it straightforward to identify and target. The presence of the additional stuffed animal could slightly complicate the task by requiring the robot to carefully avoid knocking it off.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The setup is simple, the lighting is good, and the frog is clearly visible from at least one angle. The main challenge is the presence of the additional stuffed animal next to the frog, which requires the robot to execute the task with some precision to avoid knocking off unintended objects. Overall, the task does not require highly dexterous manipulation, but it does require careful targeting and controlled movement.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_fast_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: policy A actually knocked over the frog but failed to completely knock off the green frog off the box. on other hand, policy B completely failed by just knocking off the brown bear and didn't touch the green frog",

Both angles clearly show the robot's gripper, the workspace, and the objects placed on the table. The top-down view provides a clear perspective of the gripper's orientation relative to the objects, which is beneficial for accurately assessing the horizontal alignment task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the workspace and objects. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder observation or task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"point your end gripper straight horizontally and freeze after.\" is understandable, but slightly ambiguous. It does not specify clearly in which horizontal direction the gripper should point (e.g., towards a specific object or direction). The grammar and spelling are correct, and capitalization is consistent.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a workspace with a perforated black surface, a cardboard box placed centrally, and a few smaller objects stacked on top of the box. There is minimal clutter, and the objects are clearly visible and well-defined. The objects do not appear to obstruct or interfere significantly with the robot's ability to point its gripper horizontally.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The robot only needs to orient its gripper horizontally and freeze, which does not require complex manipulation or precise interaction with small or intricate objects. The clear visibility, simple setup, and lack of clutter further simplify the task. The only minor difficulty could arise from the slight ambiguity in the horizontal direction the gripper should point, but overall, the task is straightforward.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_fast_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: both policies just failed to follow instructions completely.",

The third-person view clearly shows the overall environment, including the robot, table, and cups, providing good context. However, the top-down wrist camera view is less clear, as the green cup is partially obscured by the robot's gripper, making it difficult to precisely determine the cup's orientation and exact position from this angle.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up the green cup force it back on the table\" contains a grammatical error and is somewhat ambiguous. The phrase \"force it back on the table\" is unclear and could be interpreted in multiple ways, such as placing the cup firmly back down or simply returning it to the table. Clarifying this wording would improve task understanding.\n\nScene: The scene is set in a kitchen-like environment with a wooden table surface. Two cups (one green and one white) are placed on the table, clearly separated from each other. The green cup, which is the target object, is easily distinguishable from the white cup. The environment is relatively uncluttered, with minimal distractors or unnecessary objects that could interfere with the task. The cups are upright and easily accessible, although the wrist camera view partially obscures the green cup.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The environment is clear and uncluttered, and the target object (green cup) is easily identifiable and accessible. However, the ambiguity in the task description (\"force it back on the table\") and the partial obstruction of the green cup in the wrist camera view could introduce some uncertainty or difficulty in precise manipulation. Overall, the task should be manageable with minor clarifications and adjustments to the camera angle.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_fast_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Policy A picked up a cup  albiet the wrong one (the white cup instead of the green cup) and it  it held the cup up for a while but not quite 3 seconds. It was also pretty quick interms of picking up the cup in the first place. However, policy B was flailing around for most of the time, picked up the wrong color cup, and never kept it back on the table.",

Policy Overview  \npaligemma_fast_specialist_droid is a vision-language manipulation policy that can quickly generate gross motion plans, find single rigid objects, and execute direct pick-and-place actions with moderate reliability. It excels when the goal is \u201cpick X and put it in/on Y\u201d and both objects are clearly visible.  However, the controller frequently under-finishes actions (e.g., grasping but not releasing, or stopping short of the target), occasionally freezes, and struggles with tasks that demand fine motor accuracy, multi-step sequencing, or compliance with nuanced linguistic constraints (negations, relational phrases, conditional logic).\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \nOverall head-to-head record across 101 judged episodes:  \n\u2022 47 wins\u2003\u2022 26 ties\u2003\u2022 28 losses  \nThis yields a 46 % win-rate, a 28 % loss-rate, and a 26 % tie-rate.\n\nDetailed comparative observations  \n\u2022 Simple one-shot pick or pick-and-place tasks were a consistent strong suit: the policy defeated the competitor in 26 of 34 such episodes, e.g., \u201cpick up the brown bear\u201d <ref>81baf7e7-80eb-4901-8bf1-48bc66db77ab</ref>, \u201cpick up the green bowl\u201d <ref>c53bcbf0-c324-4e28-b342-761a0ac4a31c</ref>, and \u201cput the tape on the plate\u201d <ref>22a1ce25-b099-4e0d-abae-2d798695e39f</ref>.  \n\u2022 Performance degrades on precision-placement or delicate actions: it lost most episodes that involved pouring, stacking, insertion, or hanging\u2014e.g., pouring nuts <ref>7f924418-7d2a-43ba-a3d6-024065acbc9a</ref>, stacking bowls <ref>6e73b31f-eef2-4545-8ee1-1e3cb143437b</ref>, hanging a ring on a pole <ref>78c9a5c6-b24e-4ec5-a84d-9efa31c9f0a9</ref>, and stacking tape rolls <ref>2eb8d874-df32-4944-87e0-0b26cb7b43f9</ref>.  \n\u2022 Drawer and door manipulation is mixed: wins when the competitor froze (<ref>18d95f1f-0c8f-4746-b2f5-aa1c5edfcfd0</ref>, <ref>2176fbf7-5de1-4ff4-b92a-f0ad36c26df2</ref>) but losses when precise closing force or alignment was required (<ref>ab7ae88f-750b-4166-91de-6c9a4443f96f</ref>, <ref>e2a260e2-02e0-4ad0-996f-90a59fec01cb</ref>).  \n\u2022 Cloth or flexible-object tasks are a systematic weakness (0 wins, 5 losses/ ties) as seen in folding episodes <ref>5e8fff1a-1b89-4e75-abbf-7abc20d6b217</ref>, <ref>90051b4c-d2dc-469f-abb0-df823449b64e</ref>, and draping <ref>a6fdbff4-b300-4110-b680-df8a33b97a04</ref>.  \n\u2022 The policy usually gains an edge when the rival policy freezes or takes no action (e.g., \u201cuncap the pen\u201d <ref>b9475de7-c97f-49f3-baff-dafc842b597d</ref> and \u201cclose the top drawer\u201d <ref>29f138ba-a77d-4b00-8b73-4e82f20e5178</ref>).  \n\u2022 It under-performs when instructions require negation or conditional logic: tied/ lost on \u201cdo not move\u201d <ref>70d3d182-d4fd-405a-ac2b-5476e575195c</ref> and \u201cknock off the frog if there is no frog do nothing\u201d <ref>2e1549d3-8eb4-464c-90ce-9300925622f0</ref>.  \n\u2022 Relative accuracy in color/shape identification is decent (wins on \u201cpick up the blue cup\u201d <ref>1f595450-e0bc-47b8-b70c-650849115eb3</ref>) but fails when fine discrimination matters (\u201cpick the yellow-gray brush, not white\u201d where it chose the wrong brush) <ref>376267da-36e5-4ba5-b062-42a63af2e2e7</ref>.  \n\u2022 Recovery from small errors is limited: once a mis-grasp occurs the arm tends to pause or oscillate, letting the competitor overtake (e.g., lost stirring episodes <ref>2b63766e-3fe0-4198-bfdd-cf7c4cb23b7</ref>, <ref>31e52219-98d4-4941-89b6-94276b5df5b3</ref>).  \n\nKey comparative insights  \n\u2013 Outclasses peers on clear-view, single-grasp pick-and-place tasks.  \n\u2013 Falls behind on precision operations (pour, stack, hang, fold).  \n\u2013 Comparable or worse when language contains negations, qualifiers, or multi-step sequencing.  \n\u2013 Benefits disproportionately when the opposing policy stalls; otherwise its win margin narrows.  \n\u2013 Consistency is moderate: sequences of wins are often followed by freezes or mis-grasp losses, indicating unstable execution quality.\n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Direct, efficient trajectories toward isolated rigid objects (\u201cpick up the carrot and place it in the bowl\u201d executed cleanly) <ref>785d31f2-c30b-4a66-989f-6e259ed6ea63</ref>.  \n\u2022 Reliable whole-object grasps on medium-sized items such as bowls, cups, and bottles, frequently lifting cleanly off the surface (e.g., green bowl fully lifted) <ref>c53bcbf0-c324-4e28-b342-761a0ac4a31c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Maintains task focus in cluttered scenes better than its opponents (e.g., ignored nearby tape and grabbed mustard bottle for shelf task) <ref>1ee6d898-1876-4232-8250-e15f3ce6cac9</ref>.  \n\u2022 Able to operate under sub-optimal lighting; still identified and picked a brown bear in a dim scene where the competitor mis-aligned the gripper <ref>81baf7e7-80eb-4901-8bf1-48bc66db77ab</ref>.  \n\u2022 Handles basic spatial re-positioning (moving mouse left) decisively on first attempt <ref>43b0190d-e747-4f92-b8d4-072bc727a220</ref>.  \n\u2022 Shows occasional corrective re-tries after a near miss, leading to eventual success (grasped bread after lid removal) <ref>db1d1cb7-8aa5-42b5-93fe-0b6ceb14a623</ref>.\n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Freezing or no-motion episodes against active opponents (<ref>214e965c-cfe4-418b-8f88-41ee94939fe4</ref>, <ref>70d3d182-d4fd-405a-ac2b-5476e575195c</ref>, <ref>72b etc\u2026>) causing easy losses.  \n\u2022 Frequently stops before completing the final placement or fails to release (egg never reached bowl <ref>017ea417-3191-4f51-a81d-64519d969829</ref>; lid held too long <ref>0104e304-97be-4f8b-a0af-064a27dcf596</ref>).  \n\u2022 Mis-identifies fine object distinctions (yellow-gray vs white brush <ref>376267da-36e5-4ba5-b062-42a63af2e2e7</ref>; \u201cdifferent color\u201d task picked wrong object <ref>17635a7c-5bb8-455f-984b-f0869926ff18</ref>).  \n\u2022 Poor at deformable or articulated objects: lost or tied in all cloth folding / draping episodes (<ref>5e8fff1a-1b89-4e75-abbf-7abc20d6b217</ref>, <ref>90051b4c-d2dc-469f-abb0-df823449b64e</ref>).  \n\u2022 Limited fine-motor precision\u2014missed stacking, pouring, ring-hanging tasks (<ref>7f924418-7d2a-43ba-a3d6-024065acbc9a</ref>, <ref>78c9a5c6-b24e-4ec5-a84d-9efa31c9f0a9</ref>, <ref>6e73b31f-eef2-4545-8ee1-1e3cb143437b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Susceptible to distraction; veers toward irrelevant items (drawer episode <ref>e2a260e2-02e0-4ad0-996f-90a59fec01cb</ref>, basket episode <ref>28f37798-fb92-46ee-b137-08d1125412ae</ref>).  \n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Parses straightforward imperative phrases well (\u201cpick up the blue cup\u201d <ref>1f595450-e0bc-47b8-b70c-650849115eb3</ref>).  \n\u2022 Struggles with negations / conditionals: acted instead of staying still in \u201cdo not move\u201d <ref>70d3d182-d4fd-405a-ac2b-5476e575195c</ref> and ignored the \u201cif no frog do nothing\u201d clause <ref>2e1549d3-8eb4-464c-90ce-9300925622f0</ref>.  \n\u2022 Handles multi-part instructions poorly\u2014either completes only the first half or confuses order (cloth-then-bowl sequence failed) <ref>a6fdbff4-b300-4110-b680-df8a33b97a04</ref>.  \n\u2022 Sensitive to color descriptors in most cases but occasionally swaps similar items (dish-brush confusion) <ref>376267da-36e5-4ba5-b062-42a63af2e2e7</ref>.  \n\u2022 Minor typos in user text (\u201cput the bowl in the towl\u201d) did not prevent it from acting, but it still lost, suggesting robustness to language errors yet weakness in spatial reasoning <ref>8807b50e-01b1-4f49-8931-395b48e2224d</ref>.  \n\n6.

The third-person view clearly shows the red box and its position on the table, providing good spatial context. The top-down view from the wrist camera clearly shows the red box directly below, giving a precise perspective for grasping. Both views together provide sufficient visual information for the robot to execute the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is somewhat dim, creating dark areas and shadows around the objects and environment. The red box is still visible, but the dim lighting could slightly complicate the robot's perception and grasping accuracy. Improved lighting would enhance visibility and ease task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up the red box\" is clear, concise, and unambiguous. There are no spelling or grammatical mistakes, and the description is straightforward and easy to understand.\n\nScene: The scene setup is relatively simple, with minimal clutter. The red box is clearly visible and placed on a flat surface, making it accessible for grasping. There is a cardboard box and a small stack of cards or papers on the table, but these objects are placed away from the red box and do not significantly interfere with the task. The red box is oriented upright and open, which could slightly complicate grasping depending on the robot's grasping strategy.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The simplicity of the task description and the minimal clutter in the scene make the task relatively straightforward. However, the dim lighting conditions and the open orientation of the red box could introduce minor challenges in accurately perceiving and grasping the object. Overall, the task is manageable but could benefit from improved lighting conditions.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: policy A did not do anything -- just froze. policy B actually picked up the red box at its third attempt.",

The third-person view clearly shows the objects and their relative positions on the table, providing good spatial context. The top-down view from the wrist camera clearly shows the brown bear and its immediate surroundings, which is beneficial for precise manipulation. Both angles together provide sufficient visual information for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is somewhat dim, creating shadows and darker areas, particularly noticeable around the edges and corners of the workspace. The brown bear and other objects are still visible, but the dim lighting could slightly complicate the robot's perception and manipulation accuracy.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up the brown bear\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the object to be manipulated, leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's goal.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black table surface with a few objects placed on it, including the target object (brown bear), a green toy, a colorful box, and a small stack of cards or books. There is also an open cardboard box in the background. The brown bear is clearly visible and positioned upright, making it easily accessible. The other objects are spaced apart and do not significantly interfere with the task, although the colorful box and green toy are relatively close to the bear and could potentially be minor distractors.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The brown bear is clearly visible, upright, and easily distinguishable from other objects, simplifying object recognition and grasping. However, the dim lighting conditions and proximity of other objects could slightly increase the complexity of precise manipulation.

The third-person view clearly shows the overall environment and the objects placed on the table, while the top-down view provides a closer look at the immediate area in front of the robot. However, neither image clearly shows a green frog, making it difficult to confirm the presence or absence of the target object.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"knock off the green frog. if there is no frog, do nothing.\" is clear and understandable. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The instructions are straightforward and unambiguous.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black perforated table surface with cardboard boxes stacked in the center. There is a small object placed on top of the boxes, but it is not clearly identifiable as a green frog from the provided images. There is minimal clutter or distractors, and the environment is relatively simple. However, the uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of the green frog makes the task ambiguous.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately difficult due to the ambiguity regarding the presence of the green frog. The robot must first clearly identify whether the green frog is present or not, which is challenging given the provided images. If the frog is indeed absent, the task is straightforward, as the robot is instructed to do nothing. If the frog is present but not clearly visible, the robot may struggle to correctly identify and knock it off. The manipulation itself would be simple if the frog is clearly visible and accessible.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: both policies were terrible at the task because they did not follow directions of doing nothing. both policies were equally bad and failed.",

The bread is clearly visible inside the pot, although the pot lid is partially covering it, which may slightly increase the complexity of grasping the bread.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The bread is clearly visible and accessible, and the cutting board is conveniently placed nearby. However, the presence of the pot lid partially covering the bread may require the robot to perform a slightly more precise manipulation to avoid collision with the lid. Overall, the task seems manageable, given the clear visibility, good lighting, and straightforward setup.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid won\nEvaluation notes: A and B both got the lid off the pot. A struggled but eventualy was able to grasp the bread, while B never went low enough to grab the bread. To the credit of B, it was faster and more decisive than A.",
            "Session ID: 4050abe7-2f99-4582-9688-26c92a10e8da\nTask: Move the computer mouse to the left\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera and two third-person views from the left and right sides. These angles clearly show the computer mouse, the workspace, and the robot's position relative to the mouse. The top-down view is particularly helpful for precise positioning and manipulation, while the side views provide good context of the environment and robot's workspace.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the mouse and workspace. There is a minor glare on the monitor screen, but it does not affect the visibility of the mouse or the workspace. No significant shadows or dim areas are present that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Move the computer mouse to the left\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the object to manipulate (computer mouse) and the direction of movement (to the left). There is no ambiguity or spelling mistake in the provided description.\n\nScene: The scene setup is organized and relatively uncluttered. The computer mouse is placed clearly on a green cutting mat, making it easy to identify and grasp. The workspace includes a keyboard, monitors, and some cables, but these objects are positioned away from the mouse and do not appear to interfere with the task. There is sufficient open space to the left of the mouse, providing a clear path for the robot to move the mouse without obstruction.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The mouse is clearly visible, isolated, and placed in an accessible orientation on a flat surface. There are no immediate obstacles or clutter around the mouse that would complicate grasping or moving it. The robot has ample space to execute the required manipulation, and the provided camera angles and lighting conditions further simplify the task.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Policy A moved towards the mouse, but when it got close it started backing away. After that it froze for a while and then started moving towards the mouse again, but never attempted a grasp. Policy B moved confidently with large movements and completed the task swiftly."

        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npaligemma_vq_droid is a vision-language manipulation policy that usually produces fast, committed motions once it has selected a target.  It demonstrates solid capability on straightforward single-object pick-and-place or push tasks and occasionally shows more advanced behaviours such as rotating a loaf of bread or closing drawers.  However, its perception pipeline is brittle: it sometimes grasps the wrong item, stops moving mid-episode, or fails to finish a multi-step plan.  The policy rarely performs exploratory \u201cactive perception,\u201d so if the target is not in its initial field of view it often freezes.  Overall it achieves a roughly balanced win-rate against peer policies but with large task-to-task variance.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\nOverall H2H record across 90 evaluated episodes  \nWins 38   Losses 30   Ties 22  \n\n\u2022 The policy out-performed rivals on 42 % of the tasks, under-performed on 33 %, and matched them on 24 %.  \n\u2022 It is markedly stronger on simple single-step pick-and-place / relocation tasks (e.g., \u201cblue cup in mug\u201d, \u201cyellow fork on napkin\u201d, \u201cmove mouse\u201d) where it won 15 of 20 such encounters.  \n\u2022 Performance drops on tasks that require (a) picking a very specific object among distractors, (b) multi-step sequences, or (c) deformable / pouring manipulation; it lost 17 of 27 such episodes.  \n\u2022 Victories are often attributed to speed and decisiveness (\u201cmoved quickly and confidently\u201d in placing the cup in the mug <ref>d8a69e9b-a82c-4096-93a3-013f922a4dac</ref>) whereas losses are frequently due to wrong-object grasps or inactivity (\u201cstops at original point, do nothing\u201d <ref>bcae556a-6884-4f8c-a5e9-8f8ad2b11aa7</ref>).  \n\nKey head-to-head insights  \n\u2013 Fast, decisive completion beat a slower competitor on tasks like knocking the bear off a box <ref>041ac340-d55c-4239-b3f9-f1b4ada86095</ref> and unplugging a cable <ref>ff717942-5d20-421c-b1a5-e4ebc4876a53</ref>.  \n\u2013 When the task demanded high precision the policy often lost: it picked up a pen instead of the stapler <ref>559e048f-acf7-4225-bb64-1cd903970a38</ref>, touched the wrong book <ref>13e10649-3ae9-45e8-995b-42a1cb27280c</ref>, or failed to grasp a pineapple at all <ref>bcae556a-6884-4f8c-a5e9-8f8ad2b11aa7</ref>.  \n\u2013 In cluttered scenes it sometimes won by simply avoiding extra objects\u2014for example it deposited a carrot neatly while the rival collided with the drawer <ref>e7ec66ae-95c0-4601-b044-a9313914dfca</ref>.  \n\u2013 It shows above-average skill at opening / closing furniture: victories on \u201cclose drawer\u201d <ref>e2a260e2-02e0-4ad0-996f-90a59fec01cb</ref> and \u201copen middle drawer\u201d <ref>9a0f599b-2831-44b8-be25-ba3fc606c320</ref>.  \n\u2013 Multi-stage tasks remain a weakness for all policies, but paligemma often fares worse: both policies failed to put the red bowl in the silver bowl then drape the cloth, resulting in a tie <ref>8b205c5a-e5d3-4a46-a79f-937780babf4b</ref>.  \n\u2013 It occasionally beats competitors through better grasps (e.g., grabbing mug by the handle for pouring <ref>018316ac-98d8-4d40-b973-cc6704e4ff70</ref>), but also loses when it never releases the object (purple plum remained in gripper <ref>0b76325d-fba2-429e-9b83-ead0d22722b4</ref>).  \n\u2013 Insertion-type actions (marker into jar, pen into bottle) usually end in ties or losses, indicating parity or deficiency in dexterity.  \n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Quick, direct trajectories on simple pick-and-place (\u201cblue cup in mug\u201d) <ref>d8a69e9b-a82c-4096-93a3-013f922a4dac</ref>  \n\u2022 Consistent success with container drop-offs: carrot \u2192 drawer <ref>e7ec66ae-95c0-4601-b044-a9313914dfca</ref>, yellow fork \u2192 napkin <ref>5973ab15-b6d5-4c70-813e-b3a759b282b9</ref>  \n\u2022 Robust drawer interaction: closing a drawer <ref>e2a260e2-02e0-4ad0-996f-90a59fec01cb</ref>, opening middle drawer while competitor stayed idle <ref>9a0f599b-2831-44b8-be25-ba3fc606c320</ref>  \n\u2022 Ability to manipulate orientation tasks (90\u00b0 bread rotation) precisely <ref>c3d4f82d-cf43-4d6c-83df-70405087178a</ref>  \n\u2022 Good at mobile-object relocation across the workspace, e.g., moving computer mouse left <ref>4050abe7-2f99-4582-9688-26c92a10e8da</ref>  \n\u2022 Occasional strategic grasp choices (holding mug by handle for pouring) <ref>018316ac-98d8-4d40-b973-cc6704e4ff70</ref>  \n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Frequent object confusion: grasped a pen instead of the stapler <ref>559e048f-acf7-4225-bb64-1cd903970a38</ref>; wrong book selected <ref>13e10649-3ae9-45e8-995b-42a1cb27280c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Inactivity / freezing for entire episode (pineapple place <ref>bcae556a-6884-4f8c-a5e9-8f8ad2b11aa7</ref>, battery in bowl <ref>2c5255b0-55af-4c62-912c-2c3ef2c1f67b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Poor fine manipulation: repeatedly failed to drop marker into jar <ref>1bd6a7c9-9ee5-4916-8483-01dd32eb93bc</ref>, or to insert banana into bottle <ref>47b5e345-1a8c-40dc-b4ef-da6ebfc37960</ref>.  \n\u2022 Limited soft-object handling: knocked frog over instead of grasping <ref>f2ef5ad7-bb6d-42f6-97c7-d096449abd31</ref>; failed cloth folds <ref>9e74b344-c280-456c-afb5-2c367ffeed4f</ref>.  \n\u2022 Multi-step sequencing errors (ignored second step in bowl-then-cloth task <ref>8b205c5a-e5d3-4a46-a79f-937780babf4b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Does not respect exclusivity constraints\u2014touched distractors while instructed to touch only red box <ref>d80e7555-39aa-44e3-8858-333a5034b07b</ref>.  \n\u2022 Jittery or oscillatory motions when higher dexterity is needed (pouring cup to bowl <ref>8f1c30b2-713c-448f-9b17-29ef56cdb5fd</ref>).  \n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Simple imperatives are followed reliably (e.g., \u201cput carrot in drawer\u201d <ref>e7ec66ae-95c0-4601-b044-a9313914dfca</ref>).  \n\u2022 Struggles with negation / constraints: both utensils tasks violated \u201cdon\u2019t touch the brush\u201d <ref>c76acf8c-6df7-42cc-bcf2-5ac45df2ae22</ref>; touched other items while asked to \u201cjust touch the red box\u201d <ref>d80e7555-39aa-44e3-8858-333a5034b07b</ref>.  \n\u2022 Ambiguous or grammatically broken prompts reduce performance (\u201cPut towel blue bowl\u201d led to wrong focus and a loss <ref>a65a52a6-ecf7-47f7-9805-18bef9f45d80</ref>).  \n\u2022 Handles polite or redundant language reasonably (\u201cplease please drop\u2026\u201d task still attempted utensils <ref>c76acf8c-6df7-42cc-bcf2-5ac45df2ae22</ref>).  \n\u2022 Sequence instructions often only partially executed; e.g., policy ignored second clause in red-bowl-then-cloth sequence <ref>8b205c5a-e5d3-4a46-a79f-937780babf4b</ref>.  \n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning strengths  \n\u2022 Correctly identified bottom vs middle drawers and avoided wrong handles in several tasks <ref>e7ec66ae-95c0-4601-b044-a9313914dfca</ref>, <ref>9a0f599b-2831-44b8-be25-ba3fc606c320</ref>.  \n\u2022 Chose handle grasp for pouring mug, showing awareness of object affordances <ref>018316ac-98d8-4d40-b973-cc6704e4ff70</ref>.  \n\nScene reasoning weaknesses  \n\u2022 Failed category discrimination among similar items (flower-covered book vs plain book) <ref>13e10649-3ae9-45e8-995b-42a1cb27280c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Opened a drawer with the wrong coloured handle despite explicit colour reference <ref>cea4a5f4-7cb7-4513-8590-dd646cec97ad</ref>.  \n\u2022 Rarely repositions camera/wrist to gain visibility; freezes if initial view is obstructed <ref>bcae556a-6884-4f8c-a5e9-8f8ad2b11aa7</ref>.  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasp & place: high success rate on rigid items into large receptacles (cup-in-mug, cube-in-bowl).  \n\u2022 Orientation control: rotated bread accurately <ref>c3d4f82d-cf43-4d6c-83df-70405087178a</ref>.  \n\u2022 Drawer / door interactions: can push or pull handles reliably.  \n\u2022 Weak insertion: repeated failures with marker-into-jar <ref>1bd6a7c9-9ee5-4916-8483-01dd32eb93bc</ref>.  \n\u2022 Pouring / fluid-like tasks often jittery and inaccurate <ref>8f1c30b2-713c-448f-9b17-29ef56cdb5fd</ref>.  \n\u2022 Soft or deformable objects (towel, sponge, cloth) frequently mishandled or dropped <ref>6d0b94cd-d502-45c6-bd24-3f0387542588</ref>.  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \n\u2022 Handles moderate clutter well when the target is visually salient (e.g., busy kitchen scene but still moved mouse <ref>4050abe7-2f99-4582-9688-26c92a10e8da</ref>).  \n\u2022 Sensitive to occlusion from its own wrist camera; tasks with obscured targets often end in inactivity <ref>f1326bd2-884b-4c9d-a649-a08f84d1c7f0</ref>.  \n\u2022 Lighting changes: performance degrades slightly in dim scenes (bread & cup tasks under dim lights resulted in slower or inaccurate motions <ref>1537083d-55dd-421b-89e4-dcc48846928a</ref>).  \n\u2022 Color-based confusion increases when distractor items share colour/shape (frog vs bowl <ref>f2ef5ad7-bb6d-42f6-97c7-d096449abd31</ref>).  \n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Freezing / no movement after initial pose <ref>bcae556a-6884-4f8c-a5e9-8f8ad2b11aa7</ref>, <ref>f1326bd2-884b-4c9d-a649-a08f84d1c7f0</ref>.  \n\u2022 Grasping wrong object of similar shape/colour <ref>559e048f-acf7-4225-bb64-1cd903970a38</ref>, <ref>a65a52a6-ecf7-47f7-9805-18bef9f45d80</ref>.  \n\u2022 Half-completion: holds object but never releases (purple plum task) <ref>0b76325d-fba2-429e-9b83-ead0d22722b4</ref>.  \n\u2022 Dropping item prematurely, then idling (banana into bottle) <ref>47b5e345-1a8c-40dc-b4ef-da6ebfc37960</ref>.  \n\u2022 Collisions or knocking target away (green frog toppled <ref>f2ef5ad7-bb6d-42f6-97c7-d096449abd31</ref>).  \n\u2022 Ignoring second step of multi-step instructions <ref>8b205c5a-e5d3-4a46-a79f-937780babf4b</ref>.  \n\nIn summary, paligemma_vq_droid is a competent generalist manipulator that excels in single-step pick-and-place tasks and fast decisive actions but still needs improvements in perception robustness, fine manipulation, and disciplined instruction adherence, especially for multi-step or constraint-rich commands.",
        "summary": "- Comparative Performance: 42 % wins vs peers over 90 trials; excels on fast, single-step pick-and-place and drawer tasks; loses when high precision, multi-step sequencing, deformable objects or insertions are required.\n\n- Strengths: Quick, direct trajectories; reliable container drop-offs and drawer open/close; accurate object re-orientation; occasional smart grasp choices (e.g., mug handle).\n\n- Weaknesses: Frequent wrong-object grasps, complete inactivity episodes, poor fine dexterity for insertion/pouring, mishandles soft items, and often ignores later steps or exclusivity constraints.\n\n- Instruction Following: Simple imperatives followed well; struggles with negation, constraints, ambiguous wording, and multi-clause commands, typically executing only the first clause.\n\n- Reasoning: Correctly identifies drawer hierarchy and object affordances; limited category/color discrimination and almost no active perception, so occlusions or mislabelled colors cause errors.\n\n- Manipulation Skills: Strong rigid grasp-and-place, orientation control, and furniture interaction; weak insertion, pouring, and deformable-object manipulation.\n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Tolerant of moderate clutter; sensitive to self-occlusion, dim lighting, and similar-looking distractors.\n\n- Common Failure Modes: Freezing without motion, grasping wrong item, never releasing or prematurely dropping objects, collisions, and skipping later instruction steps.",

The top-down view clearly shows the robot's gripper and the objects directly beneath it, but the red box mentioned in the task description is not clearly visible or identifiable in either image. The third-person view provides a broader perspective of the environment but also does not clearly show the red box, making it difficult to determine the exact location or presence of the target object.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the workspace and objects. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"just touch the red box and nothing else\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the robot's objective. However, the red box itself is not clearly visible or identifiable in the provided images, introducing ambiguity regarding the exact target object.\n\nScene: The scene setup includes a perforated black table surface with several objects placed on one side, including a stuffed animal, cardboard boxes, and a cloth. These objects could serve as distractors or obstacles. The described red box is not clearly visible in the provided images, making it difficult to determine its orientation, visibility, or accessibility. The presence of multiple unrelated objects could potentially interfere with the robot's ability to precisely identify and touch only the red box.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately difficult due to the ambiguity regarding the location and visibility of the red box. Although the task itself (touching a single object) is straightforward, the unclear presence and position of the target object, combined with the presence of distractors, increase the complexity. The robot would need to accurately identify the red box among other objects and carefully avoid touching anything else, requiring precise perception and controlled movement.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_vq_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_vq_droid won\nEvaluation notes: policy A tries to touch the red box but takes a long time to do anything and ends up failing by touching the green frog first. Policy B goes sstraight for the red box and knocks it over but fails in that it touches other items. Policy B was much more decisive and quicker while Policy A was testing my patience.",

It excels when the goal is \u201cpick X and drop it at Y\u201d in uncluttered scenes, and it often moves decisively toward the right region of the workspace.  However, its high-level task reasoning is fragile: the agent frequently confuses similar-looking items, mishandles multi-step or negative instructions, and struggles with fine-alignment skills such as inserting, stacking, or releasing objects precisely.  Overall head-to-head play shows it is competitive but slightly below par, winning roughly one-third of all trials and losing about 40 %, with the remainder ending in ties.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \nOverall record across the 95 evaluated episodes: **33 wins \u2013 39 losses \u2013 23 ties**.  \nWins are concentrated on simple pick-and-place or push tasks; losses cluster around color discrimination, drawer/door manipulation, multi-step tasks, and \u201cdon\u2019t move/touch\u201d instructions.\n\nKey head-to-head insights  \n\u2022 Superior on uncomplicated pick-and-place into open receptacles: pineapple\u2192bowl <ref>bcae556a-6884-4f8c-a5e9-8f8ad2b11aa7</ref>, frog\u2192out-of-bowl <ref>37778af3-2b6c-4b66-a28c-c8c0ec08b481</ref>, block\u2192silver bowl <ref>db2e3274-4a50-4095-879d-41608dc97180</ref>.  \n\u2022 Regularly beats peers on \u201cpickup + drop\u201d without fine alignment (e.g., marker\u2192jar <ref>c5c9e0b7-3b47-4459-b179-268e857362a0</ref>, marker\u2192whiteboard <ref>7f017668-c3f8-4547-b441-2ea5547b106d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Consistently underperforms on container-insertion with orientation requirements: carrot\u2192red bowl dropped once <ref>88823fcb-c494-4544-86a1-c3b50604592f</ref>; green cylinder never reached bowl before timeout <ref>c5e62dc1-3a58-423c-9f66-0a02f126b78f</ref>.  \n\u2022 Drawer/door interaction is a weakness: lost at closing/opening drawers in multiple trials (<ref>0a25f1d8-f70c-4665-a1d2-9ef150eaf466</ref>, <ref>cea4a5f4-7cb7-4513-8590-dd646cec97ad</ref>).  \n\u2022 Beats competitors in clutter tolerance tasks such as cleaning beans with a cloth <ref>1910d9d3-813c-4b1b-ab94-0401000ad25c</ref>, but loses when precise color segmentation is required (picked red ball instead of purple object <ref>c076f615-d098-4733-9711-a7dc1dc8e064</ref>).  \n\u2022 Handles \u201cpush/knock\u201d better than peers (frog knock-off vs. mis-targeted bear <ref>cd3628b2-6029-4c6e-b34b-094763cd934f</ref>), yet often fails to complete the \u201coff-table\u201d part (clear cup still on table, tie <ref>96c24f50-7d22-42c3-8ace-16749aa99e2c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Loses almost all negative/inaction commands: moved despite \u201cdo not move\u201d <ref>70d3d182-d4fd-405a-ac2b-5476e575195c</ref> and grasped forbidden spoon <ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>.  \n\u2022 Multi-step routines frequently incomplete: failed to fold towel <ref>dab90390-74ef-428a-8001-1742cca1e5f0</ref>, to add lid after carrot <ref>68fe1184-6439-44a6-8b01-0750ebac0abf</ref>, or to remove pot lid before adding bread <ref>d185ddd4-a856-4217-85df-e73686cdbefa</ref>.\n\n3.

Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Handles direct imperatives (\u201cpick up X\u201d, \u201cput Y in Z\u201d) well, often beating peer on clarity-critical tasks (<ref>bcae556a-6884-4f8c-a5e9-8f8ad2b11aa7</ref>, <ref>db2e3274-4a50-4095-879d-41608dc97180</ref>).  \n\u2022 Struggles with negated or passive directives: moved when told \u201cdo not move\u201d <ref>70d3d182-d4fd-405a-ac2b-5476e575195c</ref>; grasped banned spoon despite emphatic wording <ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>.  \n\u2022 Conditional presence checks (\u201cif there is no frog, do nothing\u201d) were ignored\u2014tied rather than winning because both acted <ref>2e1549d3-8eb4-464c-90ce-9300925622f0</ref>.  \n\u2022 Ambiguity increases error rate: misunderstood \u201ctowel blue bowl\u201d yet still beat rival by guessing plausible intent <ref>a65a52a6-ecf7-47f7-9805-18bef9f45d80</ref>.  \n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning is adequate for \u201cobject inside container\u201d but weak for color and relational cues.  \n\u2022 Correctly inferred that frog had to be extracted, not entire bowl moved <ref>37778af3-2b6c-4b66-a28c-c8c0ec08b481</ref>.  \n\u2022 Failed to deduce that lid must be removed before bread insertion <ref>d185ddd4-a856-4217-85df-e73686cdbefa</ref>.  \n\u2022 Often selects easiest visible grasp rather than reasoning about instruction priority, e.g., chose nail puller instead of red stapler <ref>bb75fd74-e346-46b9-90e4-95339133283a</ref>.  \n\u2022 Spatial reasoning for pointing and orientation poor\u2014lost on \u201cpoint at kettle\u201d <ref>6c4e72b0-850f-4bd1-8d19-691db2f23349</ref> and \u201cgripper horizontal & freeze\u201d <ref>3c14888e-87c7-42dd-897e-8e8542a060cb</ref>.  \n\n7.

The third-person view clearly shows the green frog placed on top of the brown box, providing a good perspective of the scene and the objects involved. The top-down view from the wrist camera also clearly shows the green frog and the box, although the robot's gripper partially obstructs the view. Overall, the camera angles sufficiently capture the necessary objects and environment for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is adequate, clearly illuminating the green frog, the brown box, and the surrounding environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"just knock off the green frog off the brown box and nothing else\" is clear and understandable. It explicitly states the object to manipulate (green frog), the action required (knock off), and the object to avoid disturbing (brown box). There are no spelling or grammatical mistakes, and the lowercase usage is consistent and does not affect clarity.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a brown cardboard box placed on a flat, perforated black surface. The green frog is clearly positioned on top of the box. There is a plush toy partially visible on the box, which could potentially act as a distractor or obstacle. However, the frog is clearly separated from this plush toy, making it possible to complete the task without interference. The scene is relatively uncluttered, with minimal distractions or unnecessary objects.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The green frog is clearly visible, well-positioned, and easily accessible on top of the box. The box is stable and large enough to avoid accidental displacement. The presence of the plush toy as a distractor slightly increases the difficulty, but it is positioned far enough from the frog to minimize interference. Overall, the task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making it straightforward to execute.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_diffusion_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_diffusion_droid won\nEvaluation notes: policy A actually knocked over the frog but failed to completely knock off the green frog off the box. on other hand, policy B completely failed by just knocking off the brown bear and didn't touch the green frog",

The top-down view clearly shows the workspace directly beneath the robot, but the green frog mentioned in the task description is not visible in either image. The third-person view provides additional context of the environment but also does not show the green frog. Thus, the camera angles provided do not clearly show the object necessary for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is sufficient and evenly distributed, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or make the task harder to observe or complete.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"knock off the green frog. if there is no frog, do nothing.\" is clear and understandable. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The instructions are straightforward and unambiguous.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black pegboard surface with cardboard boxes placed centrally. There is no visible green frog in either image. The boxes and the small card-like object on the side do not appear to significantly clutter or distract from the task. However, the absence of the green frog, which is the primary object of interest, makes it impossible to carry out the task as described.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears difficult or impossible to complete based on the provided images, as the green frog is not visible in the scene. Without the presence of the target object, the robot cannot perform the instructed action. If the frog were present, the task would likely be straightforward, as the workspace is clear and well-lit, and there are no significant obstacles or clutter.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_diffusion_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_diffusion_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: both policies were terrible at the task because they did not follow directions of doing nothing. both policies were equally bad and failed.",

The objects and workspace are clearly visible.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"point your end gripper straight horizontally and freeze after.\" is understandable but slightly ambiguous. It does not specify the exact orientation or direction in which the gripper should point horizontally. There are no spelling or grammar mistakes, and capitalization is consistent.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a workspace with a perforated black surface and a cardboard box placed centrally. There is also a smaller object placed on top of the box. The workspace is relatively uncluttered, with minimal distractors or unnecessary objects. The objects present do not appear to interfere significantly with the robot's ability to complete the described task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy, as it only requires the robot to orient its gripper horizontally and hold position. The workspace is clear, the lighting is good, and the objects present do not pose significant obstacles or require precise manipulation.

The third-person views clearly show the pineapple and bowl, providing good spatial context and clear visibility of the objects and environment. The top-down view from the wrist camera is somewhat obstructed by the robot's gripper, partially blocking the view of the pineapple and bowl, making it slightly less clear for precise manipulation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient overall, with no significant shadows or glares affecting visibility. The objects and workspace are clearly illuminated, making it easy to distinguish the pineapple and bowl. There are no dim areas or lighting issues that would hinder the robot's ability to perform the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up the pineapple and place into the bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the objects involved and the required action, leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected behavior.\n\nScene: The scene setup is simple and uncluttered, consisting of only two relevant objects: a pineapple and a bowl. Both objects are clearly visible, placed on a plain white surface, and there are no distractors or unnecessary clutter that could interfere with the task. The pineapple is positioned upright, making it easy to grasp, and the bowl is placed nearby, clearly accessible for placing the pineapple inside.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The simplicity of the scene, clear visibility, good lighting, and straightforward object placement contribute to a low difficulty level. The pineapple is upright and easily graspable, and the bowl is conveniently positioned, requiring no complex or precise manipulation. The only minor challenge is the partial obstruction in the wrist camera view, but this is unlikely to significantly impact the task execution.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_diffusion_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_diffusion_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Policy A performs smoothly pick and place, finished at ease.

The third-person views clearly show the overall environment, the compartments, and the bowl, but the purple object mentioned in the task description is not clearly visible. The top-down view provides a clear close-up of the objects within the compartments, but again, the purple object is not visible, causing uncertainty in identifying the target object.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up the purple object and place into the bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. However, the described purple object is not visible in the provided images, creating ambiguity regarding the target object's location and identity.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a wooden compartmentalized box placed on a white table, with a bowl clearly visible in one compartment. Several distractor objects, including an orange ball and a watermelon-shaped object, are present. The described purple object is not visible in any provided images, making it difficult to identify and locate the target object. The compartments and distractors may add complexity to the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately difficult due to the ambiguity regarding the purple object's visibility and location. The presence of distractor objects and multiple compartments could further complicate the robot's ability to identify and grasp the correct object. However, the clear visibility of the bowl and adequate lighting conditions somewhat mitigate the difficulty. The main challenge is the unclear location and visibility of the purple object, which is essential for task completion.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_diffusion_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_diffusion_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: Smooth pick and place motion, wrong color selected (picked red object instead of purple).",

It frequently finds and grasps the correct object on the first attempt and often finishes easy, well-lit tabletop tasks within the time budget. However, the policy shows limited high-level planning, weak object\u2013attribute grounding (especially color), and a tendency to \u201cstall\u201d or hold an object in mid-air when a second action is required. Performance degrades in dim lighting, heavy clutter, or when the instruction requires multi-stage reasoning.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \nOverall results across the 103 head-to-head episodes:  \nWins 47 | Losses 39 | Ties 17 \u2003(win-rate \u2248 46 %, loss-rate \u2248 38 %).  \n\nKey insights (all relative to the competing policy):  \n\u2022 Superior on straightforward pick-and-place into containers: stacked-bowl tasks (<ref>70292884-f521-4567-8986-6640566547fb</ref>), marker-in-cup (<ref>24f3883a-d9a9-4351-ba8a-df85ab678168</ref>), block-in-bowl (<ref>1e1ddded-c37d-432f-b5c0-838e38fce94a</ref>).  \n\u2022 Often wins push/knock actions because it explores faster (dustpan push <ref>bc84dde3-b274-4256-b532-38d608875f41</ref>; stacked-blocks push <ref>bcc8c9c6-e4dd-401b-9225-7bfc247a53d1</ref>).  \n\u2022 Performs well at relative-placement tasks that require only one spatial relation (fork right of plate <ref>07fbba6f-3409-48b5-964a-614b72cc0cac</ref>; point at kettle <ref>6c4e72b0-850f-4bd1-8d19-691db2f23349</ref>).  \n\u2022 Regularly loses multi-step or sequence tasks\u2014e.g., \u201ctouch a book then the bear\u201d where the rival at least attempted the second step (<ref>4cdf7321-f9ad-4a9d-8529-cf7cc08b6f20</ref>).  \n\u2022 Under-performs when precise rotation is needed (put mug upside-down lost to rival\u2019s better grasp stability <ref>9b70548e-b1c6-4c3d-8364-fba34a77949b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Drawer/cabinet interaction is mixed: wins on \u201cput marker in drawer\u201d (<ref>4d49c628-82eb-4457-93a2-34f1af710fa6</ref>) but loses on \u201cclose drawer\u201d when distractors exist (<ref>18d95f1f-0c8f-4746-b2f5-aa1c5edfcfd0</ref>).  \n\u2022 Competitor beat pi0_droid on tasks requiring handling several objects or \u201call items\u201d logistics (place all items on orange tile <ref>107cb4bf-2e5a-46e1-84c1-f45467de56e6</ref>).  \n\u2022 Color grounding errors led to losses against policies that picked the correct hue (green marker vs purple marker mis-grasp <ref>fcd79a4d-50c9-4342-aa19-93881eb68264</ref>; red bottle task <ref>d40e2c68-068e-4f60-8546-3432f3190fcb</ref>).  \n\u2022 In ambiguous-language episodes both policies generally tied, indicating comparable difficulty (incomplete object name <ref>5cea1a60-a992-420c-b919-bc2183b2d2f6</ref>).  \n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Fast, smooth pick-and-place: immediate approach and deposit in \u201cput doll in bag\u201d <ref>16e5bbda-57c1-4e58-a24a-b39ee8142d41</ref>.  \n\u2022 Reliable pushing/pointing primitives (dustpan push <ref>bc84dde3-b274-4256-b532-38d608875f41</ref>; pointing at kettle <ref>6c4e72b0-850f-4bd1-8d19-691db2f23349</ref>).  \n\u2022 Basic stacking competence: bowls (<ref>70292884-f521-4567-8986-6640566547fb</ref>) and blue blocks (<ref>7b034400-d225-4d3d-be8e-462f6fcb83d0</ref>).  \n\u2022 Can recover from minor grasp slips\u2014e.g., re-aligned during \u201cstack the bowls\u201d (<ref>fc4c7448-d940-4620-8841-8472bd1368ed</ref>).  \n\u2022 Maintains safety margins; fewer collisions compared to rival in espresso-machine scene (<ref>0a22cb51-9c64-43eb-948a-b795ce51edd0</ref>).  \n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Frequent object-identity confusions (grabs purple marker for green marker <ref>fcd79a4d-50c9-4342-aa19-93881eb68264</ref>; white cup instead of green cup <ref>45c5df4a-1bdd-437c-83ad-3ae2485e0e03</ref>).  \n\u2022 Hesitates after first sub-goal\u2014holds cube above bowl until timeout (<ref>ac0ea231-970e-4385-8c79-721106e792aa</ref>).  \n\u2022 Poor at multi-object logistics: fails to move all items (<ref>107cb4bf-2e5a-46e1-84c1-f45467de56e6</ref>) and multi-condition \u201cducky + bowl\u201d task (<ref>bac53018-e08d-4a5d-a6be-c31ca65e32ce</ref>).  \n\u2022 Weak rotation control (unable to invert mug <ref>9b70548e-b1c6-4c3d-8364-fba34a77949b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Susceptible to dim lighting: mis-handled mustard bottle scene (<ref>1ee6d898-1876-4232-8250-e15f3ce6cac9</ref>) and apple-into-square (<ref>150591df-2cfb-4dae-a826-87a5e8824c62</ref>).  \n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Executes simple imperative commands reliably (e.g., \u201cput marker in bowl\u201d <ref>24f3883a-d9a9-4351-ba8a-df85ab678168</ref>).  \n\u2022 Handles relational language (\u201cto the right of the plate\u201d) successfully <ref>07fbba6f-3409-48b5-964a-614b72cc0cac</ref>.  \n\u2022 Struggles with sequential clauses (\u201ctouch a book then the bear\u201d)\u2014completed only the first half <ref>4cdf7321-f9ad-4a9d-8529-cf7cc08b6f20</ref>.  \n\u2022 Sensitive to color adjectives; selects wrong hue if distractor of similar shape is nearer <ref>fcd79a4d-50c9-4342-aa19-93881eb68264</ref>.  \n\u2022 Tolerant to minor typos / casing (succeeded despite uppercase \u201cPICK UP THE STRAW\u201d still failed due to perception, not language <ref>8a11cfb9-63e8-4922-ba65-5253aa9303e0</ref>).  \n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning strengths:  \n\u2013 Correctly inferred spatial relationship when pointing at distant kettle despite clutter <ref>6c4e72b0-850f-4bd1-8d19-691db2f23349</ref>.  \n\u2013 Managed \u201cnext to each other\u201d pink-object placement faster than rival <ref>8533296d-7c58-4317-b67a-7d8a5f69d781</ref>.  \nDeficiencies:  \n\u2013 Did not plan for multiple sequential moves (all items to orange tile <ref>107cb4bf-2e5a-46e1-84c1-f45467de56e6</ref>).  \n\u2013 Fails to update plan after picking wrong item; continued with erroneous object in red-bottle-in-bowl episode <ref>d40e2c68-068e-4f60-8546-3432f3190fcb</ref>.  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasp & place: high success on light, regular-shaped objects (doll, blocks, cups).  \n\u2022 Push primitives are stable and straight (block knock-over <ref>bcc8c9c6-e4dd-401b-9225-7bfc247a53d1</ref>).  \n\u2022 Basic stacking works but alignment tolerance is coarse (blue blocks fell <ref>7b034400-d225-4d3d-be8e-462f6fcb83d0</ref>).  \n\u2022 Rotation / insertion weak (could not flip mug <ref>9b70548e-b1c6-4c3d-8364-fba34a77949b</ref>; banana insertion failed <ref>8c55a6ce-fee6-42fe-bfd2-1c63f6b3fa8d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Grasps often loose on thin/floppy objects (tissue pull <ref>5afb8f69-fc7a-4404-b3eb-c395da53b3a1</ref>; cloth grasp slipped <ref>5f1333ff-0c7d-4666-af30-57dfeb3f6da0</ref>).  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \n\u2022 Maintains performance under moderate clutter (remote-in-mug amidst other items <ref>097acd46-2c04-4eb8-99a0-424df7ff44a1</ref>).  \n\u2022 Fails more often in low-light/dark material scenes (kitchen table night tasks <ref>1ee6d898-1876-4232-8250-e15f3ce6cac9</ref>, <ref>150591df-2cfb-4dae-a826-87a5e8824c62</ref>).  \n\u2022 Wrist-camera occlusion occasionally blocks key objects (straw episode <ref>8a11cfb9-63e8-4922-ba65-5253aa9303e0</ref>).  \n\u2022 Color confusion increases when distractors share shape but differ hue (marker episodes <ref>fcd79a4d-50c9-4342-aa19-93881eb68264</ref>, <ref>e3e6aed4-d623-44f6-887d-cff04559abdf</ref>).  \n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Freezes mid-task after first partial success (holding cube above bowl <ref>ac0ea231-970e-4385-8c79-721106e792aa</ref>).  \n\u2022 Picks or moves wrong object of correct class/color (white cup picked instead of green <ref>45c5df4a-1bdd-437c-83ad-3ae2485e0e03</ref>).  \n\u2022 Drops item due to weak grasp (cloth slips <ref>5f1333ff-0c7d-4666-af30-57dfeb3f6da0</ref>).  \n\u2022 Never actuates gripper after reaching target (apple hover time-out <ref>150591df-2cfb-4dae-a826-87a5e8824c62</ref>).  \n\u2022 Gets distracted by nearby objects and abandons goal (drawer closing episode <ref>18d95f1f-0c8f-4746-b2f5-aa1c5edfcfd0</ref>).  \n\u2022 Misinterprets sequential or multi-object requirements, completing only first part (book-then-bear <ref>4cdf7321-f9ad-4a9d-8529-cf7cc08b6f20</ref>; ducky + bowl in silver bowl <ref>bac53018-e08d-4a5d-a6be-c31ca65e32ce</ref>).",
        "summary": "- Comparative Performance: 46 % win, 38 % loss versus rival; excels at single-step pick-and-place into containers, pushes, and one-relation placement; falters on multi-step sequences, precise rotations, color-specific picks, and large multi-object tasks; drawer/cabinet results mixed.\n\n- Strengths: Fast, smooth motions with high first-try grasps; reliable push and pointing primitives; competent basic stacking and slip recovery; few collisions.\n\n- Weaknesses: Frequent color/identity confusions; stalls after first sub-goal; weak rotation control and multi-item logistics; performance degrades in dim lighting or heavy clutter.\n\n- Instruction Following: Handles simple imperatives and basic spatial language well; struggles with sequential clauses and color adjectives when distractors present; tolerant of typos and casing.\n\n- Reasoning: Correctly infers simple spatial relations; limited high-level planning and re-planning, leading to failures on sequential or plan-update tasks.\n\n- Manipulation Skills: Strong grasps and placements on regular objects; stable push actions; stacking alignment coarse; rotation, insertion, and thin/floppy object grasping unreliable.\n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Stays effective under moderate clutter; low-light, occlusions, and similarly shaped color distractors markedly reduce success.\n\n- Common Failure Modes: Freezes mid-task while holding object, selects wrong item, drops due to loose grasp, forgets to close gripper at target, gets distracted, completes only first part of multi-step instructions.",

The top-down view clearly shows the robot's gripper and the immediate area in front of it, but the red box mentioned in the task description is not clearly visible or identifiable from this angle. The third-person view provides a broader perspective of the environment, but similarly, the red box is not clearly visible or identifiable, making it difficult to determine its exact location or orientation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is sufficient and evenly distributed, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task. The objects and surfaces are clearly visible.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"just touch the red box and nothing else\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the robot's objective, leaving no ambiguity regarding the intended action. However, the red box itself is not clearly visible in the provided images, introducing uncertainty about the exact target object.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black perforated table surface with several objects placed on or near it, including a stuffed animal, cardboard boxes, a cloth, and some miscellaneous items. These objects could potentially serve as distractors or obstacles. The red box mentioned in the task description is not clearly visible or identifiable in either image, making it difficult to determine its exact position or orientation. The presence of multiple objects and clutter could complicate the robot's task of precisely touching only the red box.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately difficult due to the unclear visibility and identification of the red box in the provided images. The presence of multiple distractor objects and clutter on the table further increases the complexity, as the robot must carefully avoid touching anything other than the intended target. The task requires precise perception and careful motion planning to ensure successful completion without unintended interactions.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: policy A tries to touch the red box but takes a long time to do anything and ends up failing by touching the green frog first.

The third-person view clearly shows the brown bear placed on top of a box, providing a good perspective of the environment and the objects involved. However, the top-down view from the wrist camera does not clearly show the bear itself, making it difficult to precisely identify the target object from this angle alone.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"knock the brown bear off the box\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the action required and the target object, leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene setup is relatively simple and uncluttered. The brown bear is clearly placed on top of a cardboard box, making it easily identifiable and accessible. There are a few other objects present, such as additional boxes and small items, but they are positioned away from the main task area and do not appear to interfere significantly with the task execution.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be relatively easy. The bear is clearly visible and placed in an accessible position on top of the box. The robot only needs to perform a simple pushing or knocking motion, which does not require precise or dexterous manipulation. The lack of clutter and clear visibility further simplify the task.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy B\nResult: pi0_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: both policies immediately knocked the brown bear but policy A just focused on the brown bear while policy B knocked the entire box.

Both angles clearly show the workspace, the objects placed on the table, and the robot's gripper. The top-down view provides a clear perspective of the immediate area in front of the robot, while the side view gives additional context about object placement and environment.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, clearly illuminating the workspace and objects. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder observation or task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"do absolutely nothing. do not move\" is clear and unambiguous. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The instruction explicitly states that the robot should remain stationary and perform no actions.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black perforated table surface with a cardboard box and some colored objects stacked on top of it. There is also a small object placed separately on the table. The objects are clearly visible, neatly arranged, and do not appear cluttered or distracting. The robot's gripper is visible in the top-down view, positioned above the objects. The setup is simple and does not contain unnecessary clutter or distractors that would interfere with the robot's ability to follow the given instruction.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears very easy. Given the explicit instruction to remain stationary and perform no actions, the robot does not need to interact with or manipulate any objects. The clear and simple scene setup, combined with the straightforward instruction, makes this task trivial to execute.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: both policies completely failed to adhere to my instructions.",

Both views clearly show the objects involved in the task, providing sufficient visibility of the apple and book objects. The top-down view is particularly helpful for precise positioning, clearly showing the spatial arrangement of the objects.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task. The objects and their colors are clearly distinguishable.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"touch the book with the apple\" is clear and understandable. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The instruction is straightforward and unambiguous.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black perforated table surface with three square-shaped objects placed in a row, each with a clear image on top. One of these objects clearly depicts an apple, and another appears to depict a book. There are additional objects in the background (a green toy and a brown plush toy), but they are placed far enough away from the main objects and do not seem to interfere with the task. The objects relevant to the task are clearly visible, well-oriented, and not obstructed or hidden.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The objects involved (apple and book) are clearly identifiable, well-separated, and easily accessible.

The third-person views clearly show the overall environment and the compartments of the wooden box, but the top-down view provides the clearest perspective of the objects' positions and orientations, making it suitable for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the two pink objects next to each other\" is clear and understandable. It is written in lowercase letters without spelling or grammatical mistakes. However, there is slight ambiguity regarding the exact final placement of the objects, as \"next to each other\" could imply different orientations or distances.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a wooden box divided into compartments, containing several objects. The objects include a variety of colorful items, such as fruits and vegetables, and a bowl. The two pink objects mentioned in the task description are clearly visible in the top-down view, placed separately in one compartment. The other compartments contain distractor objects, but they are separated by dividers, reducing the likelihood of interference. The scene is relatively organized, with minimal clutter.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The two pink objects are clearly visible and accessible, and the compartmentalized setup reduces interference from distractors. However, the robot must precisely grasp and reposition one of the pink objects next to the other, requiring accurate manipulation and spatial reasoning. The presence of other objects in the same compartment may slightly increase the complexity of the task.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_droid won\nEvaluation notes: A tried to reach one of the pink objects, while B stucked and couldn't move.",

Both angles clearly show the objects and environment, providing sufficient visibility of the cards and the objects placed around them. The top-down view is particularly helpful for precise manipulation tasks.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows or glares that would hinder visibility or task execution. All objects and cards are clearly visible, and the environment is evenly illuminated.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up the and put it on one of the cards\" is incomplete and ambiguous, as it does not specify which object the robot should pick up. The missing object name creates uncertainty about the intended action. The grammar and capitalization are also incorrect, further reducing clarity.\n\nScene: The scene consists of three clearly visible cards placed neatly on a flat, perforated surface. There are two additional objects\u2014a green toy and a brown stuffed animal\u2014positioned near the cards. These objects could potentially serve as distractors or targets, but their presence does not significantly clutter the workspace. All objects are clearly visible and easily accessible, with no hidden or obstructed items.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately difficult due to the ambiguity in the task description. Physically, the manipulation seems straightforward, as the objects and cards are clearly visible, well-separated, and easily graspable.

There are no distractors or unnecessary objects that could interfere with the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The tissue is prominently positioned, clearly visible, and easily accessible. The robot should be able to grasp and pull the tissue without requiring highly precise or dexterous manipulation.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy B\nResult: pi0_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Policy A was more aggressive and achieved further in terms of task progression. On the other hand, policy B took repetitive actions moving the same trajectory back and forth.",
            "Session ID: 1e1ddded-c37d-432f-b5c0-838e38fce94a\nTask: Put the block in the silver bowl\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a clear top-down view from the robot's wrist camera and two third-person views from different angles. These angles clearly show the objects involved in the task (the block and the silver bowl) and their positions relative to each other, providing sufficient visual information for task execution.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or complicate the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Put the block in the silver bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There are no spelling or capitalization errors, and the instructions are unambiguous.\n\nScene: The scene is set up neatly with a checkered cloth on a table, clearly displaying the relevant objects: a blue block, a silver bowl, and an additional red bowl. The objects are well-separated and easily distinguishable. There is minimal clutter, and the presence of the red bowl could serve as a minor distractor, but it is unlikely to significantly interfere with the task. The block and silver bowl are clearly visible and easily accessible.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The block is clearly visible, centrally placed, and easily graspable. The silver bowl is also clearly visible and positioned conveniently for placing the block inside. The setup does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making the task straightforward to execute.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Policy A correctly places the block in the silver bowl where policy B places it into the red bowl. Policy A did clip the bowl a bit as it moved the block over."

        "number_of_head_to_head_evaluations": 86,
        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \nThe paligemma_binning_droid controller shows sporadic, mostly hesitant behaviour.  In the vast majority of roll-outs the arm either remained at the reset pose or performed only a short, exploratory motion before stopping.  When it does move it can localise large, well-lit objects and occasionally execute a coarse motion such as hovering above or lightly contacting them, but reliable grasping, precise placement, multi-step sequencing and recovery from errors are rarely observed.  The policy therefore appears tuned for very low-risk operation (often \u201cdoing nothing\u201d rather than acting incorrectly) but at the cost of overall task completion.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \nOverall results across the 86 head-to-head episodes:  \nWins  5\u2003|\u2003Ties  8\u2003|\u2003Losses  73  \n\nTypical win margins were narrow and usually occurred when the opponent committed an obvious error while paligemma either stayed idle or made a partial attempt (e.g., safe refusal in an out-of-distribution task).  Key comparative observations:  \n\n\u2022 Simple \u201ctouch\u201d or single-contact tasks are the only category where the policy occasionally beats another agent, e.g., simultaneously touching two books while the rival touched one <ref>6e4a029a-24a3-4d7e-beca-88d8d439ed26</ref>.  \n\u2022 In classic pick-and-place it is almost always worse; it failed on basic cube-to-bowl <ref>189d9705-ca72-46e3-870d-03ae7ededb34</ref>, pineapple-to-bowl <ref>e8dc673d-c7b1-415a-94e3-2b238588caed</ref>, marker-to-bowl <ref>24f3883a-d9a9-4351-ba8a-df85ab678168</ref> while the competing policy at least grasped objects.  \n\u2022 Relative wins are mostly \u201copponent blunders\u201d: approaching a water bottle (but still failing the grasp) was judged better than the other policy\u2019s random hovering <ref>e578f30a-1e7f-4bad-a269-4e293955b622</ref>; freezing in front of an espresso grinder was preferred over the rival opening a cabinet by mistake <ref>08bf285a-2a05-4deb-bfba-37080457e9e6</ref>.  \n\u2022 When linguistic instructions include negation, relational terms or object disambiguation, the competitor usually outperforms paligemma.  Examples include \u201cobject that is not red\u201d <ref>b6b4e19d-5b3d-4d20-8636-e0ce160eefae</ref>, \u201cleft of the mug\u201d <ref>dd4c3c4f-27d7-4c61-af76-69bf6608ad0d</ref>, and multi-object placement (\u201cred bowl AND ducky\u201d) <ref>65482c84-6eae-405c-9230-6909f05cd1ec</ref>.  \n\u2022 Drawer, door and container manipulation is a consistent weakness versus peers: close drawer <ref>41479fcb-a0d9-4672-b7ff-63da05e361f7</ref>, open drawer <ref>3f8a023f-ad3c-4194-bfe2-eeffd92bb6ab</ref>, pull door <ref>2176fbf7-5de1-4ff4-b92a-f0ad36c26df2</ref>.  In every case the rival at least attempted the handle.  \n\u2022 Under low-light or cluttered scenes (e.g., \u201cgather all items\u201d <ref>03dd60d7-a3c7-4cdc-9ad3-dbf7e293b574</ref>, \u201cpick up red cola can\u201d <ref>7ccd5be8-c1d6-4917-871d-905015915744</ref>) paligemma froze while the competitor explored.  \n\u2022 Multi-step logical tasks\u2014swap, unstack, empty, pour\u2014were universally lost; the other policy showed partial sequencing while paligemma halted (e.g., \u201cempty the bowl\u201d <ref>b126c698-34d9-4fd9-b6bf-43d04d42fcb5</ref>).  \n\u2022 The policy never outperformed a rival on any insertion, pouring or fine motor task.  \n\u2022 Idling is so frequent that ties typically arise when both policies fail completely (<ref>7516f9ba-b25f-4135-8faa-27055c6d8b8c</ref>, <ref>425ee9b1-54ad-4659-97b3-5ae9ea088205</ref>).  \n\u2022 The few outright wins that involve action (battery-to-bowl <ref>2c5255b0-55af-4c62-912c-2c3ef2c1f67b</ref>, glasses-case closing attempt <ref>b88d85aa-9dc-4742-b94e-3680f1aa05f8</ref>) still exhibit incomplete execution but exceed the opponent\u2019s even poorer attempt.\n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Safe failure: when instruction is ambiguous or likely outside its skill set, the policy prefers inaction over risky motions, which on rare occasions wins the comparison (<ref>08bf285a-2a05-4deb-bfba-37080457e9e6</ref>).  \n\u2022 Can localise and make single contacts with large planar targets; succeeded in touching two books simultaneously <ref>6e4a029a-24a3-4d7e-beca-88d8d439ed26</ref>.  \n\u2022 Occasionally demonstrates coarse visual servoing, e.g., hovering over the correct water bottle despite clutter <ref>e578f30a-1e7f-4bad-a269-4e293955b622</ref>.  \n\u2022 Able to recognise and approach small distinct objects like a battery and almost finish a deposit <ref>2c5255b0-55af-4c62-912c-2c3ef2c1f67b</ref>.  \n\u2022 Shows rudimentary object\u2013category grounding for some everyday items (books, batteries, glasses case).\n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Extreme inactivity\u2014no motion at all in over 60 episodes, e.g., <ref>b69cc947-4a6a-4ae0-88d1-cad25004e371</ref>, <ref>189d9705-ca72-46e3-870d-03ae7ededb34</ref>, <ref>e8dc673d-c7b1-415a-94e3-2b238588caed</ref>.  \n\u2022 Fails basic grasp-and-place primitives: red cube to bowl <ref>189d9705-ca72-46e3-870d-03ae7ededb34</ref>, stapler to plate <ref>2265f248-723d-42e7-899e-969512516fd2</ref>, pineapple to bowl <ref>e8dc673d-c7b1-415a-94e3-2b238588caed</ref>.  \n\u2022 Poor object discrimination\u2014selects wrong colour/object (non-red \u2192 grabs red box <ref>b6b4e19d-5b3d-4d20-8636-e0ce160eefae</ref>, cup into wrong plate <ref>b0ca9723-1ac9-4c4f-932b-e782341306e7</ref>).  \n\u2022 Unable to follow spatial relations (\u201cleft of\u201d, \u201cnext to\u201d) or negation reliably (<ref>dd4c3c4f-27d7-4c61-af76-69bf6608ad0d</ref>, <ref>9b5f7130-d139-49f2-87fb-45dc8a47ad48</ref>).  \n\u2022 Consistently fails drawer, door, lid, or case manipulation (<ref>41479fcb-a0d9-4672-b7ff-63da05e361f7</ref>, <ref>3f8a023f-ad3c-4194-bfe2-eeffd92bb6ab</ref>).  \n\u2022 No recovery behaviour after partial grasps; arm freezes mid-trajectory (<ref>0f4d8f93-75d6-4596-98ee-00f806f25888</ref>).  \n\u2022 Collisions when it does move due to straight-line approach without obstacle reasoning (<ref>ef97c98d-18fa-4bd4-a35b-6cda1ba64e8c</ref>).\n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Handles very literal, single-verb commands (\u201ctouch the book\u201d) but struggles with negation (\u201cnot red\u201d), relational prepositions (\u201cto the left of\u201d), or conjunctions (\u201cand then\u201d) as evidenced by failures in <ref>b6b4e19d-5b3d-4d20-8636-e0ce160eefae</ref>, <ref>dd4c3c4f-27d7-4c61-af76-69bf6608ad0d</ref>, and <ref>65482c84-6eae-405c-9230-6909f05cd1ec</ref>.  \n\u2022 Shows low tolerance to ambiguity; ambiguous category words (\u201cvegetable\u201d when only fruit is present) lead to complete inactivity <ref>75f2f013-65dc-4827-aab8-dc21caaa5f5a</ref>.  \n\u2022 Ignores minor typos but also ignores whole instructions containing them (\u201cpalce\u201d task froze) <ref>4f26d14f-b4a7-437d-aba5-b5d9a735393a</ref>.  \n\u2022 Reacts safely to obviously novel instructions by refusing action (freeze) rather than taking random motion, which occasionally scored higher (<ref>08bf285a-2a05-4deb-bfba-37080457e9e6</ref>).\n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning is weak: the policy rarely adjusts viewpoint, under-uses wrist camera, and cannot infer occluded handles (doors/drawers).  Textual reasoning beyond a single keyword is limited\u2014multi-step goals or conditional clauses are ignored (<ref>dc62fbd2-1f0f-46d0-9e07-967d702b85f7</ref>, <ref>d185ddd4-a856-4217-85df-e73686cdbefa</ref>).  Positive example: simultaneously contacting two distinct books required recognising \u201cdifferent\u201d <ref>6e4a029a-24a3-4d7e-beca-88d8d439ed26</ref>, showing some basic set reasoning.\n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \nGrasping: inconsistent; success only on occasional light objects (battery, books) and often stops before closure.  \nPlacing: tends to drop objects prematurely or never reaches target (mug pour <ref>ba7b5a70-7556-4697-b8a3-453fb93656d2</ref>).  \nStacking / Insertion: no successful demonstrations; lost stacking cups <ref>bbedead2-f35c-4ec2-91ee-6104cfa7743f</ref> and bowls <ref>70292884-f521-4567-8986-6640566547fb</ref>.  \nTool use / wiping / opening: never completed (eraser, cloth, pen-uncap).  \nRecovery: none; once a grasp fails the arm freezes.\n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \nPerformance degrades sharply with:  \n\u2022 Low light (<ref>03dd60d7-a3c7-4cdc-9ad3-dbf7e293b574</ref>)  \n\u2022 Clutter or distractors (<ref>7ccd5be8-c1d6-4917-871d-905015915744</ref>, <ref>2265f248-723d-42e7-899e-969512516fd2</ref>)  \n\u2022 Occluded targets (drawer handle behind objects).  \nIt shows no compensatory strategies such as camera re-positioning or exploratory sweeps.\n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Complete inactivity / freeze from start (<ref>b69cc947-4a6a-4ae0-88d1-cad25004e371</ref>, <ref>425ee9b1-54ad-4659-97b3-5ae9ea088205</ref>).  \n\u2022 Hovering above the correct object but never closing gripper (<ref>e578f30a-1e7f-4bad-a269-4e293955b622</ref>).  \n\u2022 Selecting wrong item because of colour/category confusion (<ref>b6b4e19d-5b3d-4d20-8636-e0ce160eefae</ref>).  \n\u2022 Stopping mid-trajectory after a small collision or small visual change (<ref>0f4d8f93-75d6-4596-98ee-00f806f25888</ref>).  \n\u2022 Linear approach into obstacles (coffee machine collision) <ref>ef97c98d-18fa-4bd4-a35b-6cda1ba64e8c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Failure to complete second step in multi-step instructions (pickup succeeded but placement omitted) <ref>ba7b5a70-7556-4697-b8a3-453fb93656d2</ref>.",
