        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npi0_fast_droid is a fast, reactive manipulation policy that rarely idles and generally succeeds at single-object pick-and-place routines.  When the goal object is visually salient it plans a direct path, grasps confidently, and often retries after a failed grasp.  The policy copes reasonably well with mild clutter and can manipulate flexible objects such as towels or cloths.  Limitations become evident whenever the task demands fine tool control, accurate alignment (e.g., insertions or stacking), deliberate inaction, or multi-step reasoning.  In those settings the controller may oscillate, freeze, or grasp the wrong item, and it occasionally terminates without releasing the object it is holding.\n\n2. Comparative Performance (head-to-head)  \n\u2022 Pick and Place \u2013 Across dozens of episodes pi0_fast_droid beat or tied the competing policy more often than it lost.  It routinely grasped the correct item and reached the target location, while rival policies either froze or mis-grasped (e.g., ducks into cups, cups into bowls, blocks into trays).  \n\u2022 Cover / Drape / Fold \u2013 The policy consistently outperformed its counterpart; it was usually the only agent to lift cloth or achieve partial folding, whereas competitors often merely poked at the fabric.  \n\u2022 Sorting / Classification \u2013 In repeated colour-based sorting tasks pi0_fast_droid identified target colours correctly and placed them, while the alternative policies hesitated or selected wrong colours.  \n\u2022 Move / Slide \u2013 When required to slide or reposition an object, the policy succeeded with smoother, faster trajectories; rival controllers tended to overshoot or stall.  \n\u2022 Tool Use \u2013 Performance lagged behind the comparison agent: pi0_fast_droid lost or tied in most erasing, wiping, stirring or \u201cclean the table\u201d episodes, whereas the other policies executed smoother tool contact and fewer redundant motions.  \n\u2022 Open / Close \u2013 The policy underperformed; it either failed to latch onto handles or to finish closing motions, while the competing agent completed the same drawer or cabinet tasks more reliably.  \n\u2022 Object Manipulation \u2013 When asked to re-orient blocks, pour or open bottles, the policy frequently lost or tied; the competitor could align objects more precisely or at least avoid freezing.  \n\u2022 Group / Organize / Stack \u2013 Stacking success was mixed; pi0_fast_droid often placed items near the correct spot but the rival policy achieved proper alignment more often, leading to several losses.\n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Robust grasping of familiar rigid objects; e.g., picked the cup and placed it into a basket smoothly <ref>28f37798-fb92-46ee-b137-08d1125412ae</ref>, and removed a block from a box despite flaps in the way <ref>64524de6-3682-44c5-ba19-03f550ba36fc</ref>.  \n\u2022 Re-attempt behaviour: after missing the bowl the first time it re-planned, re-grasped, and completed the pineapple placement <ref>7a84d536-013e-4ad0-9c5d-ea3be1e9474c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Effective colour/shape recognition that supports sorting and non-red discrimination tasks <ref>16e5bbda-57c1-4e58-a24a-b39ee8142d41</ref><ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>.  \n\u2022 Cloth manipulation: successfully folded a towel and achieved full coverage over a piggy-bank while the opponent merely poked <ref>647465d5-177c-4917-acd8-bc9ada7ff00c</ref><ref>06df62e9-1e4e-434b-8a6f-45448ca5c87f</ref>.  \n\u2022 Quick object search sweeps that cover shelves and table surfaces before freezing competitors, e.g., \u201cfind the creeper toy\u201d <ref>f51cd651-37a4-44f0-ab19-6c5de44fdb42</ref>.\n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Frequent freezing or limited exploration after one failed attempt, stalling entire episodes <ref>08d3d301-7027-418b-9fe7-e11b1a23c624</ref><ref>25c0a175-ad1c-468e-b55e-e1029f26d94e</ref>.  \n\u2022 Tool control deficiencies: could not keep the eraser in contact with the board <ref>00e1796c-c4d0-4017-8925-93d763f90f72</ref> or open a water bottle despite grasping the cap <ref>f845aa64-4376-485c-b58a-ca33718ea83a</ref>.  \n\u2022 Mis-identification of targets in clutter, e.g., placed tape in the wrong plate <ref>3c07a309-0dee-4aa9-b4de-df990dd06e26</ref> and grasped the robot instead of the marker meant to hit it <ref>ccf37ac0-28e7-41cf-bae0-f47350351f7d</ref>.  \n\u2022 Difficulty with precision insertions (portafilter into grinder, small cubes onto stacks) leading to losses <ref>08bf285a-2a05-4deb-bfba-37080457e9e6</ref><ref>0c7adb96-8186-4f17-b775-370fd52f7208</ref>.  \n\u2022 Does not always release objects after placement, leaving grasped items hovering and tasks incomplete <ref>5bb5f19c-c68a-40e7-b7a8-2121ca281bf9</ref>.\n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Handles colour and spatial qualifiers well (\u201cblue cup into yellow bowl\u201d succeeded) <ref>15df57dc-0daf-4556-bc67-f38a4c4f2d6d</ref>.  \n\u2022 Fails at \u201cdo absolutely nothing\u201d \u2013 still moved despite the explicit negation <ref>25c0a175-ad1c-468e-b55e-e1029f26d94e</ref>.  \n\u2022 Interprets minor typos (\u201cnon-read\u201d \u2192 non-red) correctly and complied <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>.  \n\u2022 Multi-step or relational instructions are followed inconsistently; it dropped the towel but never folded it in \u201cplace carrot then fold towel\u201d <ref>72a8f62c-49aa-4584-9162-410e140667ff</ref>.  \n\u2022 Occasionally ignores action verbs and grasps the wrong reference (picked the robot instead of using the marker to hit it) <ref>ccf37ac0-28e7-41cf-bae0-f47350351f7d</ref>.\n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning strengths: correctly inferred colour grouping goals and located all cups quickly in cluttered scenes <ref>49d1bc91-6723-4449-8296-c072b3a932df</ref>.  \nWeaknesses: often violates order constraints (tried to stack before tray placement <ref>0c7adb96-8186-4f17-b775-370fd52f7208</ref>) or stops after partial completion (emptied only one item then froze <ref>08d3d301-7027-418b-9fe7-e11b1a23c624</ref>).  Spatial reasoning is sometimes coarse; the controller places objects \u201cnear\u201d rather than \u201cinside/on top\u201d, leading to almost-correct states that still lose.\n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasping: robust with medium-sized rigid objects (cups, blocks, towels).  \n\u2022 Placing: accurate onto large, open targets; less precise for narrow targets or stacking (frequent mis-alignment of tape rolls <ref>2eb8d874-df32-4944-87e0-0b26cb7b43f9</ref>).  \n\u2022 Stacking/Inserting: partial success, but alignment errors common; blocks often dropped from height <ref>7b034400-d225-4d3d-be8e-462f6fcb83d0</ref>.  \n\u2022 Tool manipulation: weak torque control when erasing, wiping or turning caps; slips off tools or hovers without making contact <ref>00e1796c-c4d0-4017-8925-93d763f90f72</ref>.  \n\u2022 Recovery: will back-off and re-grasp after a miss instead of giving up (<ref>02eb3b54-13e4-432e-9cf6-d3a4c1fff651</ref>).  \n\u2022 Release: occasionally forgets to open gripper after placement (<ref>5bb5f19c-c68a-40e7-b7a8-2121ca281bf9</ref>).\n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \n\u2022 Handles moderate clutter and distractors, succeeding in busy kitchen and office scenes (<ref>49d1bc91-6723-4449-8296-c072b3a932df</ref>, <ref>0b8c31c1-22f8-479e-bd01-f58e4b5bb85a</ref>).  \n\u2022 Cloth backgrounds, patterned tables, and partial occlusions rarely confuse its perception.  \n\u2022 Sensitive to low-light episodes: performance degraded in dim \u201cPlace cup right side up\u201d and \u201cPut the yellow ducks in mug\u201d scenes (<ref>0a25f1d8-f70c-4665-a1d2-9ef150eaf466</ref>, <ref>754214cf-3288-47ec-b7b4-5493526bd855</ref>).  \n\u2022 Wrist-camera occlusions sometimes cause it to mis-localise small targets (e.g., screwdriver into mug task <ref>b2a2a83c-f9ee-4875-9ff4-68ab29dac20b</ref>).\n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Freezing after first error or mid-air hover with object still grasped <ref>08d3d301-7027-418b-9fe7-e11b1a23c624</ref>.  \n\u2022 Grasping the correct item but never releasing it into the goal (<ref>5bb5f19c-c68a-40e7-b7a8-2121ca281bf9</ref>).  \n\u2022 Selecting a distractor of similar colour/shape (tape vs. stapler, carrot vs. duck) <ref>3c07a309-0dee-4aa9-b4de-df990dd06e26</ref>.  \n\u2022 Over-shooting and colliding with cabinets or shelving (<ref>24bc5b01-12e1-4cd0-9365-dbb25112171c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Tool tasks: pushes or nudges the tool instead of forming a stable grasp, leading to repeated but ineffective motions <ref>bc405b62-52ac-4141-9289-1119e3eac709</ref>.  \n\u2022 Misinterpreting passive, negated, or multi-step instructions (moved during \u201cdo not move\u201d, folded towel step omitted, etc.) <ref>25c0a175-ad1c-468e-b55e-e1029f26d94e</ref><ref>72a8f62c-49aa-4584-9162-410e140667ff</ref>.\n\nOverall, pi0_fast_droid provides a solid baseline for everyday pick-and-place and cloth-handling tasks, but would benefit from improved tool manipulation control, tighter release logic, and more deliberate high-level planning for multi-step or precision-alignment scenarios.",
        "summary": "- Policy Overview: Fast, reactive controller that excels at single-object pick-and-place and basic cloth handling in mild clutter; struggles with fine alignment, tool use, deliberate inaction, and sometimes freezes or forgets to release.\n\n- Comparative Performance: Beat or tied rivals on pick/place, drape/fold, colour sorting, and sliding; lost or tied on tool tasks, open/close operations, precision re-orientation, and stacking.\n\n- Strengths: Confident, repeatable grasps; automatic re-try after misses; reliable colour/shape recognition; effective towel folding/covering; wide, rapid visual sweeps to locate targets.\n\n- Weaknesses: Episode-blocking freezes after errors, poor tool contact and torque control, target confusion in dense scenes, insertion/alignment errors, and occasional failure to open gripper at goal.\n\n- Instruction Following: Interprets colour, spatial cues and minor typos well, but ignores \u201cdo nothing,\u201d drops steps in multi-part commands, and sometimes latches onto the wrong referent.\n\n- Reasoning: Infers grouping goals and object locations competently yet violates order constraints, halts mid-task, and settles for \u201cnear\u201d rather than exact placements.\n\n- Manipulation Skills: Strong general grasping and large-target placement; alignment, stacking, and tool manipulation remain error-prone; will back-off and re-grasp, but release logic is flaky.\n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Works reliably amid moderate clutter, patterns, and partial occlusions; performance degrades in low-light and when wrist camera blocks small objects.\n\n- Common Failure Modes: Freezing with object in gripper, no release after transport, selecting visually similar distractors, cabinet collisions, ineffective tool pushes, and misreading negated or multi-step instructions.",

The red items are clearly distinguishable from the non-red items, and the bowl is placed conveniently on the table. The objects are spaced apart, allowing for straightforward grasping and manipulation. The robot should be able to complete this task without requiring highly precise or dexterous manipulation.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_fast_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_fast_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Both policies correctly identified the red lobster as one of the target items and managed to place it in the bowl. While policy A struggled more than policy B at picking up the lobster, I do see that it is a difficult item to pick up. After placing the lobster in the bowl, policy B made larger movements (moving up and back which were a bit intimidating compared to policy A. Both policies incorrectly started to grasp the egg instead of the mug afterwards (although policy B did appear to move towards the mug at first, but changed course).",

            "Session ID: fc4c7448-d940-4620-8841-8472bd1368ed\nTask: stack the bowls\nTask category: Group / Organize / Stack\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a third-person view from the side and a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. The third-person view clearly shows the overall environment, including the bowls and surrounding objects. However, the top-down view is partially obstructed by the robot's gripper, limiting visibility of some objects and potentially complicating precise manipulation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder observation or task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"stack the bowls\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the robot's objective without ambiguity or spelling errors.\n\nScene: The scene includes two bowls placed separately on a flat surface, clearly visible and accessible. However, there is a plush toy and other unrelated objects nearby, which could serve as distractors or obstacles. The bowls are upright and unobstructed, making them easy to grasp and stack.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately easy. The bowls are clearly visible, upright, and accessible, simplifying grasping and stacking. However, the presence of a plush toy and other unrelated objects introduces potential distractions or interference, slightly increasing the complexity. Additionally, the partial obstruction in the top-down view may slightly complicate precise manipulation. Overall, the task is straightforward but requires careful navigation around distractors.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_fast_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_fast_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Policy B reached closer to the target goal. Also, policy B exhibited impressive corrective behaviors that led to better performance. Meanwhile, policy A is slower and failed to perform fine-grained actions.",
            "Session ID: fcb8f0dd-ccc6-4d5e-9352-0b0a9f6c6f3f\nTask: Empty the bowl. \nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a clear top-down view from the robot's wrist camera and a third-person view from the side. Both angles clearly show the bowl and its contents, providing sufficient visibility of the objects and environment necessary for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder observation or task completion. The objects and workspace are clearly visible.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Empty the bowl.\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There is no ambiguity regarding what the robot is expected to do.\n\nScene: The scene is a kitchen countertop area with minimal clutter. The bowl is centrally placed and contains a clearly visible object inside it. There are no significant distractors or unnecessary objects that would interfere with the robot's ability to complete the task. The bowl and its contents are easily accessible and clearly visible.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The bowl is placed in an accessible location, and the object inside it is clearly visible and easy to grasp. The robot should be able to execute this task without requiring highly precise or dexterous manipulation.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_fast_droid was Policy B\nResult: pi0_fast_droid won\nEvaluation notes: A was mostly meandering around the bowl and the cubes. A sort of got close to the bowl and cubes at some points but it did nothing substantial and wasn't close to completing the task. B was much better as it went close to the bowl and cubes and hand some failed tries when trying to maniuplate the bowl and cubes. However, eventually the policy B was able to grab both cubes apick them up and take them out of the bowl, which technically completes the task. Yet, I didnt give it a full score since it struggled a bit in the beginning and never actually did the task in the the best way such as picking up the bowl and emptyingg it.",
            "Session ID: fcd79a4d-50c9-4342-aa19-93881eb68264\nTask: put the green marker on the notebook\nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include two third-person views from different angles and one top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. The third-person views clearly show the overall environment, the robot arm, and the objects involved, providing good spatial context. The top-down wrist camera view clearly shows the green marker and notebook, although the notebook is only partially visible at the edge of the frame. Overall, the camera angles sufficiently capture the necessary objects and environment for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or task execution. All objects are clearly visible, and the workspace is evenly illuminated.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the green marker on the notebook\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the objects involved and the action required, leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a countertop workspace containing several objects, including a notebook, markers (green and purple), a stapler, and some colored blocks. Although there are multiple objects present, the notebook and green marker are clearly identifiable and accessible. The notebook is placed flat on the surface, and the green marker is clearly visible and reachable. The presence of other objects, such as the stapler and purple marker, could serve as minor distractors but do not significantly interfere with the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The green marker and notebook are clearly visible, accessible, and positioned conveniently for grasping and placement. The robot does not need to perform highly precise or dexterous manipulation, as placing a marker on a notebook is straightforward. The minor presence of distractors does not significantly increase the difficulty. Overall, the task setup and clarity suggest a low level of difficulty.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_fast_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_fast_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: Both policies did not do well here since they were asked to do task with the green marker and ended up picking up the purple marker instead. Policy A also froze towards the end and policy B continously moved around during the runtime.",
            "Session ID: fd94c503-9938-4d11-a0cc-059b825ae7aa\nTask: put the toothpaste on the towel\nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a third-person view from the side and a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. The third-person view clearly shows the objects involved (toothpaste, towel, toothbrushes, cups) and their positions on the table, providing good context for the task. The top-down view clearly shows the towel, but the toothpaste is not visible from this angle, potentially making it harder for precise manipulation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is sufficient and evenly distributed, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the toothpaste on the towel\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It is written in lowercase letters, but this does not affect the clarity or understanding of the task. There is no ambiguity regarding what the robot is expected to do.\n\nScene: The scene is simple and uncluttered, with minimal distractors. Objects present include a blue towel neatly placed on the table, a tube of toothpaste placed upright in a cup, and two toothbrushes in separate cups. The toothpaste is clearly visible and accessible from the third-person view, but its upright orientation in the cup may require careful grasping. The towel is flat and clearly visible, providing a straightforward target for placing the toothpaste.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The scene is uncluttered, the objects are clearly visible and accessible, and the towel provides a large, flat surface for placing the toothpaste. The only minor challenge is the toothpaste's upright orientation in the cup, which may require careful grasping and manipulation by the robot. Overall, the task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making it manageable for the robot.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_fast_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_fast_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Policy A makes longer trajectory each step than policy B. Policy A seems to be slightly aggressive yet faster in its actions compared to policy B."

        "number_of_head_to_head_evaluations": 166,
        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npaligemma_binning_droid exhibits extremely conservative behaviour.  In most roll-outs the arm stays at, or very near, the home pose and times out without acting.  When it does move it tends to execute a single, slow Cartesian reach toward the first object it sees and then halts, rarely closing the gripper or completing follow-through motions.  This \u201cminimal-action\u201d bias occasionally prevents harmful or wildly wrong motions and therefore earns a win when competing policies behave dangerously, but it also means the policy almost never finishes the instructed task.  The controller shows no evidence of on-the-fly re-planning, grasp synthesis, or multi-step sequencing; it lacks fine-motor dexterity and releases objects unpredictably.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\u2022 Pick and Place \u2013 Across the great majority of pick-and-place episodes rival policies grasped, transported or placed objects, whereas paligemma_binning_droid either froze or stopped after an initial reach.  Its few victories in this category were awarded only because competing policies performed an obviously wrong or unsafe action (e.g., trying to open a cabinet instead of placing a portafilter).  \n\u2022 Tool Use \u2013 In every cloth-wiping, dusting or table-cleaning task opponents at least attempted to pick up the appropriate tool; paligemma_binning_droid generally remained stationary, losing head-to-head comparisons.  \n\u2022 Open / Close \u2013 For drawers, doors and lids, other policies regularly contacted handles and produced partial motion, while this policy almost never touched the articulated part, resulting in consistent under-performance.  \n\u2022 Object Manipulation \u2013 Tasks such as flipping a switch, uncapping a pen, pulling a trigger or turning a carrot showed the same pattern: competing policies moved toward or manipulated the control element; paligemma_binning_droid either hovered or did not move, so it lost every comparison.  \n\u2022 Group / Organize / Stack \u2013 In stacking or gathering tasks rival controllers made stacking attempts (even if imprecise).  The current policy\u2019s lack of grasping led to systematic underperformance.  \n\u2022 Find / Search \u2013 Competing systems swept cameras or reached toward candidate objects, whereas paligemma_binning_droid generally froze, tying only when no policy acted.  \n\u2022 Knock Over / Topple \u2013 Performance was mixed: it won a single box-topple episode because its slow push was closer to the target, but in the remainder of toppling tasks it failed to act while the competitor succeeded.\n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Safe rejection of confusing instructions \u2013 When another policy performed an obviously unrelated action, paligemma_binning_droid often opted to remain idle, leading to a win in place-portafilter-handle-task where the rival tried to open a cabinet <ref>08bf285a-2a05-4deb-bfba-37080457e9e6</ref>.  \n\u2022 Basic coarse motion toward a visible object \u2013 In a few simple layouts it produced a straight-line approach that nearly succeeded (battery-to-bowl <ref>2c5255b0-55af-4c62-912c-2c3ef2c1f67b</ref>, cable-to-tape-roll <ref>12af69f7-abf6-4102-a861-4530e7f78f92</ref>).  \n\u2022 Gentle contact and low collision rate \u2013 Episodes rarely show the gripper crashing into scenery; even during failed lid-on-bottle manipulation the arm slowed before contact <ref>d41bb537-c990-4d90-9531-751b2cfdff73</ref>.  \n\u2022 Occasional correct touch/inspection behaviour \u2013 It successfully touched two different books as requested, demonstrating some scene scanning ability <ref>6e5bf49e-ecef-43af-83d8-3157bb2d8c02</ref>.  \n\u2022 Can distinguish object colour in uncluttered scenes \u2013 It approached the ketchup bottle rather than distractor items in a pouring task <ref>8b5f086f-39b9-4628-aa8f-63446b5085e4</ref>.\n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Frequent total inactivity (policy freezes) \u2013 Seen in dozens of episodes, e.g., book pick-and-place <ref>02f67afc-8eb7-429b-ba93-c021fd5f709a</ref>, cleaning-table <ref>1910d9d3-813c-4b1b-ab94-0401000ad25c</ref>, pineapple search <ref>36a43201-5026-44f2-833f-c81bd223bb46</ref>, carrot-to-dish <ref>7d90355d-5fa1-4eab-8839-02a99099c967</ref>.  \n\u2022 Grip failures \u2013 The controller often stops with fingers open above the object (battery <ref>2c5255b0-55af-4c62-912c-2c3ef2c1f67b</ref>, lid-placement <ref>d41bb537-c990-4d90-9531-751b2cfdff73</ref>, glasses case <ref>b88d85aa-9dc4-4742-b94e-3680f1aa05f8</ref>).  \n\u2022 No release logic \u2013 When it does lift, it rarely lets go (cable/tape roll <ref>12af69f7-abf6-4102-a861-4530e7f78f92</ref>, doll pick-up <ref>16e5bbda-57c1-4e58-a24a-b39ee8142d41</ref>).  \n\u2022 Object confusion \u2013 Often approaches or grasps the wrong item (remote-between-bowls task <ref>8460a669-65a2-47cd-b8da-d9566437737a</ref>, apple instead of white ball <ref>61efb4c7-1dc6-43aa-a9ad-183fd5759ff4</ref>).  \n\u2022 Cannot execute multi-step or relational instructions \u2013 Fails when order matters (cube-then-marker bowl task <ref>dc62fbd2-1f0f-46d0-9e07-967d702b85f7</ref>) or when spatial relation is specified (carrot left of mug <ref>dd4c3c4f-27d7-4c61-af76-69bf6608ad0d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Very poor performance in Tool Use and Open/Close \u2013 Never completed wiping, dusting, drawer or door operations (clean-table <ref>425ee9b1-54ad-4659-97b3-5ae9ea088205</ref>, open-drawer <ref>3f8a023f-ad3c-4194-bfe2-eeffd92bb6ab</ref>).  \n\u2022 Sensitive to lighting \u2013 Episodes shot in dim environments led to immediate freezing (find-pineapple <ref>36a43201-5026-44f2-833f-c81bd223bb46</ref>, push-plate-into-cup <ref>934888cd-305e-4281-9d33-b34da4f4ba04</ref>).\n\n5. Instruction Following  \nThe agent parses simple \u201cpick X, place Y\u201d language but struggles with:  \n\u2022 Negation or exclusion (\u201cpick the yellow-gray brush, not the white one\u201d) \u2013 resulted in total inactivity <ref>376267da-36e5-4ba5-b062-42a63af2e2e7</ref>.  \n\u2022 Relational phrases (\u201cto the left of\u201d, \u201cbetween\u201d) \u2013 ignored or mis-executed (carrot left of mug <ref>dd4c3c4f-27d7-4c61-af76-69bf6608ad0d</ref>, remote between bowls <ref>8460a669-65a2-47cd-b8da-d9566437737a</ref>).  \n\u2022 Compound instructions \u2013 typically performs zero steps (red cube out, marker in task <ref>dc62fbd2-1f0f-46d0-9e07-967d702b85f7</ref>).  \n\u2022 Minor typos or lowercase wording do not noticeably degrade performance (cable onto tape roll <ref>12af69f7-abf6-4102-a861-4530e7f78f92</ref>), but the policy also fails many perfectly spelled commands, suggesting language parsing is not the main bottleneck.\n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning is weak: the policy rarely adjusts to object geometry (failing to clear pot rim when placing bread <ref>d185ddd4-a856-4217-85df-e73686cdbefa</ref>) and makes no visible attempt to plan collision-free paths.  Text reasoning is limited to single-object goals; when the goal involves sets or ordering it freezes or selects wrong items.  One positive example is recognising two independent book touches <ref>6e5bf49e-ecef-43af-83d8-3157bb2d8c02</ref>, indicating it can enumerate multiple goal objects when phrased very simply.\n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Reaching: slow, straight-line motions to roughly the correct XY point are common.  \n\u2022 Grasping: success rate is very low; fingers often close in free space or stop above the target (yellow object <ref>a794910b-05a5-4843-937c-c10fec8fcdbf</ref>).  \n\u2022 Transport: when it does grasp, trajectories are smooth and without oscillation (battery-to-bowl episode <ref>2c5255b0-55af-4c62-912c-2c3ef2c1f67b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Placement / Release: seldom opens gripper at destination, leading to partial success or task failure (lid on bottle <ref>d41bb537-c990-4d90-9531-751b2cfdff73</ref>).  \n\u2022 No evidence of complex skills such as insertion, pouring, stacking, wiping or recovery after a slip.\n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \nThe policy handles uncluttered, well-lit setups acceptably but freezes in:  \n\u2022 Low-light scenes <ref>36a43201-5026-44f2-833f-c81bd223bb46</ref>, <ref>934888cd-305e-4281-9d33-b34da4f4ba04</ref>.  \n\u2022 Dense, colourful clutter where saliency is ambiguous (kitchen counter with many cups <ref>799b7ad2-df1b-48e9-a356-0df90c21d3ac</ref>).  \nCamera-angle changes do not help because the controller rarely exploits wrist-camera information.\n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Full freeze / no motion \u2013 first action never issued (<ref>02f67afc-8eb7-429b-ba93-c021fd5f709a</ref>, <ref>7eb1ac2d-a631-4187-9480-f15b688e079c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Hover-without-grasp \u2013 arm stops a few centimetres above the target (<ref>cadbb03a-1ca9-458f-bc79-b5575a77dc10</ref>, <ref>d0038ba6-95f6-4c8a-94a7-7d09392ec5fd</ref>).  \n\u2022 Wrong-object selection \u2013 grasps distractor instead of goal (<ref>8460a669-65a2-47cd-b8da-d9566437737a</ref>, <ref>b69cc947-4a6a-4ae0-88d1-cad25004e371</ref>).  \n\u2022 Grasp without release \u2013 object held until timeout (<ref>2c5255b0-55af-4c62-912c-2c3ef2c1f67b</ref>, <ref>12af69f7-abf6-4102-a861-4530e7f78f92</ref>).  \n\u2022 Partial manoeuvre then stall \u2013 initial reach followed by prolonged idle (battery, marker-in-bowl <ref>a8cce4e8-a143-448d-ac5a-58e8f5b2eb3d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Mis-handling multi-step commands \u2013 completes zero or only first sub-goal, ignores rest (<ref>dc62fbd2-1f0f-46d0-9e07-967d702b85f7</ref>, <ref>d185ddd4-a856-4217-85df-e73686cdbefa</ref>).\n\nOverall, paligemma_binning_droid prioritises safety and inaction over task completion.  While this occasionally pays off in head-to-head safety comparisons, its manipulation repertoire, planning and instruction comprehension need dramatic improvement to be competitive across the evaluated task spectrum.",
        "summary": "- Policy Overview: Extremely conservative; arm often stays at home pose and times out; seldom grasps, rarely completes tasks; no re-planning, fine dexterity or multi-step sequencing.\n\n- Comparative Performance: Consistently underperforms rivals across all task families; almost never finishes pick-and-place, tool use, open/close or manipulation jobs; occasional wins only when competitors act unsafely.\n\n- Strengths: Safety-first stance yields low collision rate and some head-to-head victories; capable of slow straight-line reaches toward clear targets, basic colour discrimination, and occasional correct touch actions.\n\n- Weaknesses: Frequent total inactivity, grasp and release failures, wrong-object picks, inability with multi-step or relational goals, very poor tool and articulation handling, sensitive to low light.\n\n- Instruction Following: Handles simple \u201cpick X, place Y\u201d; fails on negation, spatial relations, compound commands; minor typos tolerated, but complex phrasing usually leads to freezing rather than error.\n\n- Reasoning: Little geometric or path planning awareness; scene and language reasoning limited to single objects; freezes on ordering or set goals, with only rare multi-object success.\n\n- Manipulation Skills: Slow, roughly accurate reaches; grasp success very low, releases rare; transport smooth when it does grasp; no higher-level skills like insertion, stacking, wiping or recovery.\n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Performs acceptably only in well-lit, uncluttered setups; freezes in low-light or cluttered environments; extra camera views provide little benefit.\n\n- Common Failure Modes: Full freeze, hover without grasp, wrong-object selection, grasp without release, partial move then stall, incomplete multi-step execution.",

Overall, the camera angles are sufficient and provide clear visibility of the objects and environment necessary for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the book and surrounding objects. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up the book and then put it down\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It is straightforward and unambiguous, clearly indicating the expected action from the robot.\n\nScene: The scene setup includes a robot arm positioned near a book placed open on a cloth-covered surface. The environment contains shelves and cabinets with various objects, such as boxes, plants, and books, but these items are placed away from the immediate workspace and do not directly interfere with the task. The book is clearly visible, open, and lying flat, making it easily accessible for manipulation. There is no unnecessary clutter or distractors that would significantly impede the robot's ability to complete the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The book is placed openly and flat on a stable surface, providing straightforward access for the robot's gripper. The clear visibility, adequate lighting, and absence of interfering objects or clutter further simplify the task. The robot does not need to perform highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making the overall difficulty low.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_binning_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_binning_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: policy A did nothing.

The third-person views clearly show the overall environment, the placement of objects, and the robot's position relative to the objects. The top-down view provides a clear and detailed perspective of the objects on the surface, making it easy to identify the red marker and the purple bowl. Overall, the camera angles are sufficient and provide clear visibility for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or make the task difficult. All objects are clearly visible, and their colors and positions can be easily distinguished.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Put the red marker in the purple bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There are no spelling or grammar mistakes, and the capitalization is consistent and appropriate. The task is unambiguous and straightforward.\n\nScene: The scene setup includes a countertop with several objects placed on it, including a red marker, a purple bowl, a blue bowl, a yellow corn-shaped object, a purple marker, and a spice container. There is also a drying rack with additional unrelated objects. Although there are multiple objects present, the red marker and purple bowl are clearly identifiable and not obstructed or hidden. The additional objects could serve as distractors, but they are spaced apart enough to minimize interference with the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The red marker and purple bowl are clearly visible, easily identifiable, and placed in accessible positions. The robot has sufficient space to maneuver and grasp the marker without obstruction. The task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making it straightforward to execute successfully.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_binning_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_binning_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Policy B completely froze and did not move. Policy A picked up the marker but was not able to move it towards the purple bowl. Policy A only was able to pick up the marker while Policy B did not move at all.",

The third-person view is somewhat distant and angled, making it difficult to clearly discern details of the objects and their exact positions. The top-down view provides a clearer perspective of the objects' positions and orientations, but the visibility is still limited due to darkness and camera angle.\n\nLighting: The lighting is insufficient, with significant dimness and shadows present. The objects are difficult to clearly identify, and the dark environment makes it challenging to observe details, potentially complicating the robot's ability to accurately perceive and manipulate the items.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"gather all items\" is clear, concise, and free of spelling or grammatical errors. However, it lacks specificity regarding where the items should be gathered or placed after collection, introducing some ambiguity.\n\nScene: The scene contains three visible objects: a green toy, a small stack of cards or books labeled \"numbers,\" and a brown plush toy. The objects are spaced apart and clearly separated, with no significant clutter or distractors. However, the dim lighting and dark background may make it challenging for the robot to accurately detect and grasp the objects.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately difficult. While the objects are clearly separated and not obstructed, the poor lighting conditions significantly increase the difficulty. The robot may struggle with accurately identifying, locating, and grasping the items due to limited visibility and contrast. The lack of clarity regarding the final placement of gathered items also adds a minor layer of complexity.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_binning_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_binning_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: policy A actually reached for the bear but the policy failed to pick it up. It just knocked the bear off the table. Policy B did nothing. Policy A is much better",

The third-person views clearly show the robot arm, the coffee grinder, and the portafilter handle, providing good spatial context. The top-down view clearly shows the portafilter handle and the coffee grinder slot, offering a precise perspective for alignment and manipulation. Overall, the camera angles are sufficient and provide clear visibility of the objects and environment necessary for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or make the task difficult. The objects and environment are clearly illuminated, allowing easy identification and manipulation.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"place portafilter handle into coffee grinder slot\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the required action and the objects involved, leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene setup includes a coffee grinder placed on a table with a checkered tablecloth, a portafilter handle lying on the table, and some furniture and shelves in the background. Although there are additional objects in the background, such as boxes, plants, and shelves, they are sufficiently distant and unlikely to interfere with the task. The portafilter handle is clearly visible and oriented in a way that should facilitate grasping. The coffee grinder slot is also clearly visible and accessible, with no immediate obstacles or clutter around it.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately easy.

        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npaligemma_fast_droid is an agile, vision-conditioned manipulation policy that almost always \u201cdoes something\u201d instead of freezing.  In uncluttered scenes it quickly generates a straight-line trajectory, closes the gripper decisively, and tends to finish simple pick-and-place moves within the time limit.  The policy, however, invests little effort in mid-task replanning: once an early contact or grasp is wrong it rarely recovers, and it frequently neglects the final placement / release phase.  Multi-step tasks that require reasoning beyond a single grasp\u2013place cycle routinely expose these limitations.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\u2022 Find / Search \u2013 The policy was consistently better than peers at visually locating and touching a specified item.  In every \u201ctouch / find\u201d episode (books with flower, cat, orange cover; plant on shelf) the other policy either touched the wrong object or did not move, whereas paligemma_fast_droid correctly reached the target in most runs.  \n\u2022 Move / Slide \u2013 In both dedicated sliding tasks (\u201cpush dustpan\u201d, \u201cpush ball\u201d) the policy lost; the competing policy either completed the push or made further progress while paligemma_fast_droid produced small, ineffective nudges or wandered.  \n\u2022 Tool Use \u2013 Across wiping, scooping and pouring episodes the policy under-performed.  It lost to the competitor when a cloth, spoon or marker had to be used as a tool, whereas the rival policy usually managed at least a partial wipe or successful scoop.  \n\u2022 Sorting / Classification \u2013 When colour grouping or \u201call red in bowl\u201d instructions were given, paligemma_fast_droid tied or lost; competing policies more reliably selected all relevant items or avoided non-targets.  \n\u2022 Open / Close \u2013 The policy was competitive at closing actions (e.g. drawers, wet-wipe lid) but generally fell behind peers on opening tasks such as coffee machine lids or multi-drawer sequences.  \n\u2022 Move / Slide and Tool-use weaknesses outweigh its strengths, making overall comparative performance mixed rather than category-leading in most skills.\n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Robust, first-try grasping of medium-sized objects: quick, centred grasps on bottles, blocks or markers even when the competitor stalled <ref>03d8876b-761b-4476-a226-1aa03a13ffdd</ref><ref>189d9705-ca72-46e3-870d-03ae7ededb34</ref>.  \n\u2022 Handles height / viewpoint variation better than peers; succeeded at \u201ctowel to sink\u201d on a low work-surface where the rival failed <ref>08651de3-d44b-4b5c-b89b-5d40468b60c7</ref>.  \n\u2022 Performs well in dim or low-contrast scenes that stalled the baseline policy, e.g. locating and boxing a blue cup in near-darkness <ref>799b7ad2-df1b-48e9-a356-0df90c21d3ac</ref>.  \n\u2022 Strong at visual search tasks: rapidly homed in on the correct book or plant while the alternative picked a distractor <ref>13e10649-3ae9-45e8-995b-42a1cb27280c</ref><ref>3a37e56d-832c-43f7-baa9-02c270f8f745</ref><ref>f262fddc-69a3-4477-b6db-77e6fd32ecf2</ref>.  \n\u2022 Maintains smooth, high-velocity trajectories in simple pick-and-place scenes, finishing before the competitor times out <ref>0847ac20-39b9-4ac5-8086-f3b8e579ab39</ref><ref>5b10c3c3-1a7d-4716-9e06-1d28e64cedfc</ref>.\n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Frequent receptacle confusion: placed target objects in the wrong bowl or cup <ref>1e1ddded-c37d-432f-b5c0-838e38fce94a</ref><ref>101e7a98-a724-475e-ba69-4aab2ff76d41</ref><ref>56e76d78-578a-44a2-bd7c-bcc84616ee1e</ref>.  \n\u2022 Colour / object mis-identification in multi-object scenes (e.g., grasped red cube when told \u201cnon-red\u201d <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>, chose yellow duck instead of white lego <ref>ecc071f2-5dfe-48b4-83b1-c0623826803b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Tends to drop or never release items after transport, ruining otherwise correct executions <ref>082182cfd-23ee-410b-ba40-77e37e9b4eef</ref><ref>115d31f697-? see 115</ref>.  \n\u2022 Very poor at slide actions and gentle pushes <ref>fc5d4180-2ada-4092-b894-006621c31694</ref><ref>f7d2dba0-971c-41d9-9d44-28c7b44ef57b</ref>.  \n\u2022 Multi-step plans routinely fail after step 1 (e.g., open drawer + insert item <ref>c6ae4d03-9c1e-42b5-b267-c7368c669cc3</ref>, pour & replace juice <ref>c3efabdc-9788-49e2-99ad-97b62f2b9e69</ref>).  \n\u2022 Ignores negative constraints (\u201cdo NOT touch spoon\u201d) and ends up violating them <ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>.\n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Simple, single-action commands are followed reliably (e.g., \u201ctouch the orange book\u201d <ref>f262fddc-69a3-4477-b6db-77e6fd32ecf2</ref>).  \n\u2022 Performance degrades with negation or exclusions; despite repeated emphasis it still grasped the forbidden spoon <ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>.  \n\u2022 Handles minor typos in target nouns (\u201cbusket\u201d) but mis-handles colour qualifiers (\u201cnon-red object\u201d) leading to failure <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>.  \n\u2022 Multi-clause tasks (\u201copen drawer, take carrot, close drawer\u201d) are only partly completed; the policy executes the first grasp but omits later steps <ref>c6ae4d03-9c1e-42b5-b267-c7368c669cc3</ref>.  \n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene context reasoning is good for object localisation (books on shelf, hidden robot toy) but weak for sequential logic: it removed the robot from between mugs yet never finished placing it in the bowl <ref>5da5c262-e00b-42c6-a45f-6d7f54c019c2</ref>.  Task-level reasoning also fails when the goal requires understanding of relative spatial terms (left / right duck) <ref>a035597b-a8fd-4d51-a417-2f2c57a02f50</ref>.  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasping: secure grips on bottles, markers, and blocks even at awkward angles <ref>03d8876b-761b-4476-a226-1aa03a13ffdd</ref>.  \n\u2022 Placement: frequently mis-aligns over target container resulting in collisions or wrong receptacle <ref>1e1ddded-c37d-432f-b5c0-838e38fce94a</ref>.  \n\u2022 Rotation / balancing tasks show mixed success: perfect carrot rotation <ref>1b712881-42f3-4916-8d54-1126f4732c01</ref>, but incorrect bread rotation <ref>c3d4f82d-cf43-4d6c-83df-70405087178a</ref> and failed hammer balancing <ref>d25151dd-e1c7-4851-ab78-9ccdfdd94e50</ref>.  \n\u2022 Release control is unreliable\u2014object remains gripped after correct placement <ref>08651de3-d44b-4b5c-b89b-5d40468b60c7</ref><ref>082182cfd-23ee-410b-ba40-77e37e9b4eef</ref>.  \n\u2022 Sliding / gentle pushes are rarely executed; end-effector oscillates without imparting sufficient force <ref>fc5d4180-2ada-4092-b894-006621c31694</ref>.  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \n\u2022 Maintains performance under very low illumination where the rival froze <ref>799b7ad2-df1b-48e9-a356-0df90c21d3ac</ref>.  \n\u2022 Tolerates height changes (success on low utility table <ref>08651de3-d44b-4b5c-b89b-5d40468b60c7</ref>) and moderate clutter (successfully extracted red bottle surrounded by distractors <ref>e8f5d5ff-5fa3-497d-ae23-05a9951f7654</ref>).  \n\u2022 Susceptible to occlusions from its own wrist camera; tasks with handles hidden from that view (coffee machine button, drawer handle) often fail <ref>2affc2fe-55a6-4f92-a421-875bd08155b0</ref><ref>c154c0a7-ec0a-4128-aa32-cf844ca3885e</ref>.  \n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Grabs correct item but places it in the wrong receptacle <ref>101e7a98-a724-475e-ba69-4aab2ff76d41</ref>.  \n\u2022 Picks up wrong-coloured or nearest object when distractors are present <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref><ref>25fab778-79b2-4a64-a325-91d1e21dc1df</ref>.  \n\u2022 Holds on to object and never releases <ref>082182cfd-23ee-410b-ba40-77e37e9b4eef</ref><ref>115d25151dd-e1c7-4851-ab78-9ccdfdd94e50</ref>.  \n\u2022 Freezes or jitters after a failed first grasp, leading to time-outs <ref>214e965c-cfe4-418b-8f88-41ee94939fe4</ref><ref>65fc04ef-d595-44bf-9bc5-f736f2ab43e5</ref>.  \n\u2022 Ignores negated constraints and performs forbidden action <ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>.  \n\u2022 Collision with environment while searching for handles or edges (drawer faces, cabinet doors) <ref>c6ae4d03-9c1e-42b5-b267-c7368c669cc3</ref><ref>d4297036-4874-47c2-9ee6-8923cf2c388d</ref>.\n\nOverall, paligemma_fast_droid is a competent generalist manipulator that shines at quick visual search and simple grasp-place tasks but still lags behind specialised peers on tool use, sliding, and multi-stage reasoning.",
        "summary": "- Policy Overview: Agile vision-conditioned controller that quickly executes single pick-and-place moves; rarely replans, often skips proper release, and struggles with multi-step tasks.  \n\n- Comparative Performance: Best in visual find/touch; loses on sliding, tool use and many opening tasks; ties or trails in sorting; overall mixed relative to peers.  \n\n- Strengths: Fast, centred grasps on medium objects, strong low-light and viewpoint tolerance, rapid visual search, smooth high-velocity trajectories in simple scenes.  \n\n- Weaknesses: Frequent receptacle and colour confusions, unreliable release, very poor sliding/pushes, multi-step plan drop-outs, ignores negative constraints.  \n\n- Instruction Following: Executes straightforward single-action commands; falters on negations, colour qualifiers, and multi-clause instructions despite handling minor typos.  \n\n- Reasoning: Adequate scene context reasoning for object localisation; weak sequential and spatial reasoning, leading to incomplete goal fulfilment.  \n\n- Manipulation Skills: Secure grasping, but placement mis-alignments, inconsistent rotation/balancing, unreliable gripper release, and ineffective sliding actions.  \n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Maintains performance in low light, varied heights and moderate clutter, yet susceptible to self-occlusion when handles/buttons are hidden.  \n\n- Common Failure Modes: Correct item to wrong container, grabs distractor, never releases, stalls after failed grasp, violates \u201cdo not\u201d clauses, and collides while searching for handles.",

            "Session ID: 00d2b265-f7fd-409d-8b09-3112db0046d2\nTask: Put all red items in the bowl\nTask category: Sorting / Classification\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera and two third-person views from left and right angles. These angles collectively offer a clear and comprehensive view of the objects and environment, making it easy to identify the items and their positions relative to the bowl.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of all objects. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Put all red items in the bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There is no ambiguity regarding what the robot is expected to do, and the instructions are straightforward.\n\nScene: The scene setup is simple and organized, with minimal clutter. The objects on the table include a red cup, a red lobster-shaped toy, a yellow duck, an egg, and a metallic bowl. All objects are clearly visible, well-separated, and easily distinguishable. There are no significant distractors or hidden objects that would interfere with the robot's ability to complete the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The red items (cup and lobster toy) are clearly identifiable and easily accessible. The bowl is positioned conveniently, and there are no obstacles or challenging manipulations required. The simplicity of the scene, clear visibility, and straightforward nature of the task contribute to the low difficulty level.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_fast_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Both policies correctly identified the red lobster as one of the target items and managed to place it in the bowl. While policy A struggled more than policy B at picking up the lobster, I do see that it is a difficult item to pick up. After placing the lobster in the bowl, policy B made larger movements (moving up and back which were a bit intimidating compared to policy A. Both policies incorrectly started to grasp the egg instead of the mug afterwards (although policy B did appear to move towards the mug at first, but changed course).",
            "Session ID: 018316ac-98d8-4d40-b973-cc6704e4ff70\nTask: Pour the water from the mug into the silver bowl\nTask category: Object Manipulation\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera and two third-person views from left and right angles. These angles clearly show the objects involved in the task (the mug and the silver bowl) and their relative positions. The top-down view is particularly helpful for precise manipulation, clearly showing the mug's contents and the bowl's position.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and workspace. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Pour the water from the mug into the silver bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the objects involved and the action required, leaving no ambiguity about the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene is set up on a clean workspace with minimal clutter. The objects relevant to the task (the mug and silver bowl) are clearly visible and placed on a green cutting mat, which provides good contrast. However, the mug appears to contain an object rather than water, which could cause confusion or difficulty in executing the task. Additionally, there is a red bowl nearby, which could potentially serve as a distractor, although it is distinct enough from the silver bowl to minimize confusion.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately easy. The objects are clearly visible, well-lit, and placed in accessible positions. The main difficulty arises from the mug containing an object instead of clearly visible water, potentially causing confusion or complicating the pouring action. Otherwise, the setup is straightforward, and the robot should be able to execute the task without significant difficulty.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_fast_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Both policies incorrectly tried to pour the mug into the red bowl instead of the silver bowl. Both policies were not accurate in the pouring and would have missed the red bowl. Policy B grabbed the mug by the handle instead of side which is preferable.",

The rag is clearly visible, flat, and well-positioned on the table, making it straightforward for the robot to approach and manipulate. However, the dim lighting conditions could slightly increase the difficulty, requiring careful visual processing. Overall, the task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making it relatively simple to execute.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_fast_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Policy B grabbed both sides of the rag and made a motion to fold but quit part of the way through. A did not successfully grasp the rag at all.",
            "Session ID: fda392f6-41ed-4146-bb32-dcf771c518ae\nTask: put the screwdriver in the plastic bag\nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a third-person view and a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. Both angles clearly show the screwdriver and the plastic bag, providing sufficient visual information for the robot to execute the task. The top-down view is particularly helpful for precise manipulation, clearly showing the relative positions of the screwdriver and the plastic bag.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task. The objects and environment are clearly visible.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the screwdriver in the plastic bag\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There are no spelling or grammar mistakes, and the task is unambiguous.\n\nScene: The scene setup is simple and uncluttered, containing only the necessary objects for the task: a screwdriver and a plastic bag. There is a small blue object on the table, but it is unlikely to interfere significantly with the task. The screwdriver is clearly visible and oriented in a way that should allow easy grasping. The plastic bag is open and accessible, making it straightforward to place the screwdriver inside.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The screwdriver is clearly visible, well-oriented, and easily accessible. The plastic bag is open and positioned conveniently, simplifying the insertion of the screwdriver. The lack of clutter and distractors further reduces the complexity of the task. Overall, the setup and visibility suggest that the robot should be able to complete the task without significant difficulty.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_fast_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Policy A nearly reached the final goal while policy B struggled from the beginning. Policy A was faster than policy B.",
            "Session ID: fe57eae1-8c14-4ffa-8284-aa87cf0251c3\nTask: place the plant into the bowl\nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include two third-person views from the left and right sides, clearly showing the robot arm, the bowl, and the plant. Additionally, there is a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera, which provides a close-up but limited view of the bowl and the gripper. The third-person views offer a clear and comprehensive perspective of the environment and objects, while the wrist camera view is somewhat limited but still useful for precise manipulation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"place the plant into the bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It is straightforward and unambiguous, clearly indicating what the robot is expected to accomplish.\n\nScene: The scene setup includes a table with a checkered tablecloth, a bowl placed centrally, and a plant located nearby. There are shelves and cabinets in the background containing various objects, but these are positioned away from the immediate workspace and do not directly interfere with the task. The plant and bowl are clearly visible, easily accessible, and not obstructed or hidden, making the task straightforward.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The plant and bowl are clearly visible, unobstructed, and placed in close proximity to each other. The robot has ample space to maneuver, and the objects involved do not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation. The straightforward nature of the task, combined with the clear visibility and accessibility of the objects, contributes to the overall low difficulty level.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_fast_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: A missed plant, go left and collisde with cabinet door, B goes directly to the plant. B can pick up the plant, put into the bowl, but B caan't release it. It took B 7 times to go up side down with gripper holding the plant, the policy doesn't learn how to release it, so I give -20 pts for B"

        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npaligemma_fast_specialist_droid is an agile general-purpose manipulation policy that reliably reaches for salient objects, forms stable grasps on rigid items, and executes straight-line, fairly smooth Cartesian motions.  It excels at single-step pick-and-place routines and copes well with moderate scene clutter.  Limitations emerge when tasks demand tool use, cloth manipulation, or precise multi-stage reasoning: the policy often freezes, oscillates, or drops objects instead of completing the requested fine-motor action.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\u2022 Pick and Place \u2013 Across dozens of trials the policy beats or ties its rival in most standard pick-and-place episodes.  It correctly grasped and relocated target objects in scenes where the competing policy hesitated, e.g., switching two cups, loading drawers, or moving coloured blocks, whereas the other policies frequently mis-grasped, knocked items over, or remained idle.  \n\u2022 Cover / Drape / Fold \u2013 In cloth-related tasks (folding towels, draping rags, covering bowls) the policy repeatedly under-performed: it poked or hovered while the competing policies managed at least a partial fold or drape.  \n\u2022 Tool Use \u2013 Whenever a dedicated tool (knife, spoon, spatula, board wiper, wooden spoon, pan) was required, the policy almost always lost; rivals typically achieved or nearly achieved a grasp on the tool while paligemma_fast_specialist_droid failed to pick it up or abandoned the attempt.  \n\u2022 Group / Organize / Stack \u2013 Performance is weaker than its peers: the policy dropped blocks, failed to align tape rolls, or created unstable stacks, whereas the competing systems either finished the arrangement or made more progress.  \n\u2022 Knock Over / Topple \u2013 The policy outperforms alternatives: it knocks down cylinders, cymbals, or cups with purposeful pushes while rivals often freeze or simply nudge objects without toppling them.  \n\u2022 Move / Slide \u2013 Results are mixed: it lost a head-to-head mouse-drag episode but later completed a similar slide faster than its opponent, indicating parity rather than dominance.  \n\u2022 Find / Search \u2013 Early episodes show poorer exploration, but later trials demonstrate improvement; overall results are balanced with neither clear superiority nor clear inferiority relative to the other policies.  \n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Consistent rigid-object grasping.  The policy reliably encloses cubes, cups, markers, and bowls with minimal jitter and without knocking neighbouring items\u2014e.g., smooth pick-up of the purple cup before placing it in a yellow bowl <ref>1bfb1c8a-3d9f-44dd-a5f5-713f8a5b9bdc</ref>.  \n\u2022 Good colour/shape discrimination in clutter.  It isolated the correct red hammer and ignored a distractor green hammer while its rival grasped the wrong tool <ref>16724580-ce3b-4174-9def-b834309667e3</ref>.  \n\u2022 Fast recovery from minor errors.  After dropping a stapler the arm immediately re-grasped and inserted it into the drawer ahead of the competitor <ref>8d4b1a63-cfbe-4ceb-992a-d7931c6f443b</ref>.  \n\u2022 Robust pushing/toppling motions.  It intentionally struck a cymbal and toppled vertical blocks when the competing policies stalled <ref>f11a7e13-a565-4978-8ebb-503fd5427f17</ref><ref>2d584672-de34-40f4-9993-59f47d40942b</ref>.\n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Tool manipulation failures \u2013 repeated inability to lift or orient tools (knife, spatula, wooden spoon, board wiper) <ref>03919d42-23d1-4dd7-b03c-e066de78103d</ref><ref>2b63766e-3fe0-4198-bfdd-cf7c4cb23b7b</ref><ref>4723472f-e712-4599-8576-3ef055f2d912</ref><ref>8bbcf4b1-75ef-4e4d-a58b-ce8c92dc8fe1</ref>.  \n\u2022 Cloth handling \u2013 pokes or drags fabric instead of folding or draping it <ref>06df62e9-1e4e-434b-8a6f-45448ca5c87f</ref><ref>2ef1cf78-7903-4629-95d1-a1d7183216b9</ref><ref>8f5f85bf-3145-4b1b-8311-ffbc8a4c84dc</ref>.  \n\u2022 Frequent failure to release objects after placement, costing wins on otherwise correct executions <ref>0104e304-97be-4f8b-a0af-064a27dcf596</ref><ref>02448d6d-4891-4395-82ae-7bf5f74f1225</ref>.  \n\u2022 Gets distracted by similarly coloured or shaped items (e.g., selected a purple marker instead of the required green one) <ref>b9cf4b59-5a13-4347-aeab-3a6f469d7d54</ref>.  \n\u2022 Occasional freezing/idle episodes, especially after an initial failed grasp <ref>214e965c-cfe4-418b-8f88-41ee94939fe4</ref>.\n\n5. Instruction Following  \nThe policy usually obeys simple, direct commands but struggles with:  \n\u2022 Multi-step sequencing\u2014performed first step but ignored second in stacking cubes task <ref>0c7adb96-8186-4f17-b775-370fd52f7208</ref>.  \n\u2022 Negative or relational constraints\u2014picked up the white brush instead of \u201cyellow-gray brush and not the white one\u201d <ref>376267da-36e5-4ba5-b062-42a63af2e2e7</ref>.  \n\u2022 Ambiguous references\u2014confused which cups were \u201csquare objects\u201d until extra movement clarified view <ref>0aa4186d-6fc9-40c6-97c4-42675ac6f48e</ref>.  \n\u2022 It tolerates minor typos; despite \u201cput bowl in the towl\u201d it correctly associated towel as the target surface <ref>8807b50e-01b1-4f49-8931-395b48e2224d</ref>.\n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning is generally solid for rigid objects\u2014e.g., understanding that a cup must go inside a sink, not merely near it <ref>f42e832a-ff53-4fec-93f2-b14bb94c344c</ref>.  Failures arise when spatial relations involve flexible items (cloth over drill) or when the policy must choose among look-alikes (dish brushes).  Textual reasoning degrades with compound conditions: it stacked the wrong order of plates despite reading both clauses <ref>f5d9ce11-f550-43e6-ae06-531f91cfbb37</ref>.\n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasping \u2013 High success on blocks, cups, tools with handles; struggles with very thin handles or cloth edges.  \n\u2022 Placing & stacking \u2013 Accurate placement on trays, inside bowls; stacking stability mediocre (tape rolls topple) <ref>2eb8d874-df32-4944-87e0-0b26cb7b43f9</ref>.  \n\u2022 Insertion \u2013 Reasonable at inserting items into drawers or boxes once grasped <ref>8d4b1a63-cfbe-4ceb-992a-d7931c6f443b</ref>.  \n\u2022 Error recovery \u2013 Often re-attempts after a miss, but sometimes oscillates without new strategy, especially with tools.  \n\u2022 Release control \u2013 Tendency to hold items too long, causing lingering contact or failed hand-off.\n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \nThe policy copes with moderate clutter and varied viewpoints (floor-level shelves, sinks, bookshelves).  It maintains performance under bright daylight and indoor lighting but degrades noticeably in dim scenes\u2014dropping objects or freezing when visibility is poor <ref>03dd60d7-a3c7-4cdc-9ad3-dbf7e293b574</ref><ref>568e8b89-a14d-46ad-8a7f-54ee3d654965</ref>.  Transparent or reflective targets (open plastic cup, glass drawer) also induce hesitation.\n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Freezing after first unsuccessful grasp attempt, leading to time-outs <ref>214e965c-cfe4-418b-8f88-41ee94939fe4</ref>.  \n\u2022 Dropping an item mid-air then re-grasping aimlessly (e.g., wiper, spoon) <ref>eab31cde-d2b9-469f-8d66-6b039cee14cf</ref>.  \n\u2022 Misidentifying look-alike objects (green vs purple markers, dish brushes) <ref>376267da-36e5-4ba5-b062-42a63af2e2e7</ref><ref>b9cf4b59-5a13-4347-aeab-3a6f469d7d54</ref>.  \n\u2022 Failure to release object after correct placement, nullifying success <ref>0104e304-97be-4f8b-a0af-064a27dcf596</ref>.  \n\u2022 Ineffective tool pickup\u2014repeatedly pushing or tapping the tool without securing it <ref>4723472f-e712-4599-8576-3ef055f2d912</ref>.",
        "summary": "- Policy Overview: Agile general-purpose policy; reliable rigid-object grasps and smooth straight-line motions; excels at single-step pick-and-place; falters on tool use, cloth manipulation, and multi-stage tasks, often freezing or dropping items.  \n\n- Comparative Performance: Beats or ties rivals in most pick-and-place and knock-over episodes; parity on slide/search; clearly worse on cloth, tool use, and organize/stack scenes.  \n\n- Strengths: Consistent rigid-object grasping, good colour/shape discrimination, quick re-grasp recovery, purposeful pushing/toppling that outperforms peers.  \n\n- Weaknesses: Repeated tool-handling failures, poor cloth manipulation, frequent late releases, occasional distraction by look-alikes, sporadic idle oscillations.  \n\n- Instruction Following: Obeys simple direct commands; struggles with multi-step sequences, negative/relational clauses, and ambiguous references; tolerates minor typos.  \n\n- Reasoning: Sound spatial reasoning for rigid objects and containment; degrades with flexible-item relations, look-alike differentiation, and compound textual conditions.  \n\n- Manipulation Skills: High success on grasping rigid items, accurate placements and insertions, mediocre stacking, weak thin-handle/cloth grasp, prone to over-holding objects despite some error recovery.  \n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Handles moderate clutter, varied viewpoints, normal lighting; performance drops in dim scenes or with transparent/reflective targets.  \n\n- Common Failure Modes: Freezing after a failed grasp, mid-air drops with aimless re-grasping, misidentifying similar objects, not releasing after placement, repeated ineffective tool pokes.",

            "Session ID: f42e832a-ff53-4fec-93f2-b14bb94c344c\nTask: pick the purple cup and place it in the sink\nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a third-person view and a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. The third-person view clearly shows the overall environment, including the sink, cups, and surrounding objects. The top-down view from the wrist camera clearly shows the purple cup and its position relative to the sink, providing a good perspective for grasping and placing actions.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick the purple cup and place it in the sink\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the object to be manipulated (purple cup) and the target location (sink), leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene setup is relatively simple and uncluttered. The purple cup is clearly visible and placed on the table surface, easily accessible for grasping. The sink is clearly identifiable and reachable. There are minor distractors present, such as another green cup and a dark cloth or bag placed nearby, but these objects are not directly obstructing the purple cup or the sink. The orientation and visibility of the purple cup are favorable for grasping and manipulation.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be relatively easy. The purple cup is clearly visible, isolated, and positioned in an accessible location. The sink is also clearly visible and reachable. The absence of significant clutter or obstacles simplifies the manipulation task. The robot should be able to execute the task without requiring highly precise or dexterous manipulation.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Policy B almost succeeded at the task with rapid movements together with impressive corrective behaviors. Policy A failed in the middle of the task and showed redundant motion patterns.",
            "Session ID: f43a1f67-2be7-4eee-9a72-e7a58c1c9b95\nTask: put the purple marker in the cup\nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera and two third-person views from different angles. The top-down view clearly shows the marker and cup, providing a good perspective for precise manipulation. The third-person views offer additional context about the environment and robot positioning, but the marker is less visible from these angles.\n\nLighting: The lighting is generally sufficient, but there are bright spots and reflections visible on the table surface, especially in the wrist camera view. These bright reflections and shadows could slightly hinder the robot's visual perception and make the task more challenging.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the purple marker in the cup\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There is no ambiguity regarding the goal of the task.\n\nScene: The scene setup includes a table with a transparent cup and a clearly visible purple marker placed horizontally on the surface. The environment around the table has some clutter, including additional objects and cables, but these are not directly interfering with the immediate task area. The cup is transparent, which could pose a slight challenge for visual perception, but it is clearly visible and accessible.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately easy. The marker and cup are clearly visible and placed in an accessible manner. However, the transparent nature of the cup and the bright reflections on the table surface could introduce minor visual perception challenges. Overall, the task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making it relatively straightforward.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: Both policies did not do well. Both pointed to the red marker instead of the purple marker as asked. They did point the marer in the upward position but the landing position is not quite close the top of the cup. I think the lighting has too much yellow reflection which impacts the movement prediction",
            "Session ID: f5d9ce11-f550-43e6-ae06-531f91cfbb37\nTask: Place the black plate on the white plate. Then place the cup on the black plate.\nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include two third-person views from left and right cameras and one top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. The third-person views clearly show the overall environment and the placement of objects on the table, providing good spatial context. The top-down view clearly shows the objects directly beneath the robot's gripper, offering a precise perspective for manipulation. Overall, the camera angles are sufficient and provide clear visibility of the objects and environment necessary for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or make the task difficult to observe or complete. The objects and their colors are clearly distinguishable, and the workspace is evenly illuminated.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Place the black plate on the white plate. Then place the cup on the black plate.\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There are no spelling or grammar mistakes, and the instructions are straightforward and easy to understand. The capitalization and punctuation are consistent and appropriate.\n\nScene: The scene setup is relatively simple and uncluttered, with a blue cloth-covered table clearly displaying the relevant objects: a white plate, a black plate, and a cup. The objects are placed in an accessible manner, clearly visible, and not hidden or obstructed. There are some distractors and clutter in the background and sides of the room (such as boxes, bags, and additional cups), but these are located away from the immediate workspace and should not interfere with the robot's task execution.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The objects are clearly visible, well-separated, and easily accessible, making the initial grasping straightforward. However, the task requires precise placement of the black plate onto the white plate, followed by placing the cup onto the black plate. This stacking action demands careful manipulation and accurate positioning. The robot must execute controlled and precise movements to avoid knocking over or misplacing the objects. Overall, the task is manageable but requires careful and precise manipulation.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid won\nEvaluation notes: A picked up the wrong object first. B moved to the correct object but did not successfully pick it up. B wins because it chose the correct object.",

Both angles clearly show the ice cream cone and the robot's gripper, providing sufficient visual information for the robot to execute the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows or glares that would hinder visibility or task execution. The objects and environment are clearly visible, making it easy to observe the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Feed the robot ice cream.\" is clear and understandable. However, there is slight ambiguity regarding the exact meaning of \"feed\"\u2014whether the robot should grasp the ice cream cone or simulate bringing it to a specific location. Clarifying this detail would improve task clarity. The grammar and spelling are correct, and capitalization is appropriate.\n\nScene: The scene is set in a kitchen environment with a countertop, cabinets, and appliances. The countertop is mostly clear, containing only the ice cream cone and a small unrelated object (possibly a toy or decoration). The ice cream cone is clearly visible, oriented horizontally on the countertop, and easily accessible. The unrelated object is small and placed away from the ice cream cone, unlikely to interfere with the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The ice cream cone is clearly visible, isolated, and positioned in an accessible orientation. The robot's gripper is appropriately sized and positioned to grasp the cone without requiring highly precise or dexterous manipulation. The lack of clutter and good lighting further simplify the task. The only minor difficulty could arise from the cone's horizontal orientation, which may require careful grasping to avoid dropping or damaging it.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_fast_specialist_droid won\nEvaluation notes: A understood that the robot was an important object yet if I am telling the policy to feed the robot, it makes sense for it to pick up the icecream first. However, A attempted to pick up the robot first instead of the icecream. Even when trying to pick up the robot, the policy A failed as it attempted many times to grasp the robot, but missed. B was better as it was quick to determine that it had to move the ice cream B was able to sucessfully grab the ice cream but it didnt bring it close to the robot, rather it wandered a bit and was confused after grabbing the icecream.",

        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npaligemma_vq_droid is a vision-language manipulation policy that generally reacts quickly once it has identified a goal object, produces smooth, energy-efficient trajectories, and shows a solid repertoire of basic skills: grasp-and-place, pushing, knocking, pouring, and simple tool use.  It is noticeably conservative\u2014often stopping early when confidence is low\u2014which yields many ties but also avoids catastrophic collisions.  Limitations appear in tasks that require fine alignment (insertion, stacking, cloth folding), multi-step sequencing, or interpretation of subtle language qualifiers (\u201conly\u201d, \u201cseparate\u201d, negations).  The policy occasionally fails to start, suggesting unstable action-selection when perception is uncertain.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\u2022 Pick and Place \u2013 Across dozens of match-ups the policy wins or ties more often than it loses.  It reliably out-performed peers in straightforward retrieval tasks such as putting corn in a drawer, carrot in a bowl, or bowl in drawer, while competitors frequently froze or grasped the wrong item.  Losses occurred mainly when finer accuracy (dropping into a cup or tray) was required, where other policies sometimes succeeded.  \n\u2022 Tool Use \u2013 In knife-grasping, spoon-scooping and erasing tasks the policy consistently beat rivals that either failed to pick up the tool or abandoned the task.  It was one of the few that actually wiped a board, cleaned a table, or grasped a knife handle, whereas competitors stayed static or made random motions.  \n\u2022 Object Manipulation \u2013 For non-prehensile actions (pouring, rotating bread, balancing a hammer, unplugging a cable) paligemma_vq_droid usually executed the core manipulation while opposing policies missed the target or selected the wrong object.  \n\u2022 Move / Slide \u2013 When asked to push or slide objects (mouse, cup) it completed the displacement cleanly while alternatives hesitated or oscillated.  \n\u2022 Knock Over / Topple \u2013 In the bear-knock task it toppled only the bear, whereas the rival toppled the entire box, showing better goal specificity.  \n\u2022 Cover / Drape / Fold \u2013 Performance is weaker than peers.  It won some drape tasks but lost or tied most folding episodes where competitors achieved neater folds or at least attempted more purposeful motion.  \n\u2022 Open / Close \u2013 Results are mixed: the policy closed drawers and opened a blue-handle drawer more often than others but also froze on jar and laptop tasks that competitors partially solved.  \n\u2022 Find / Search \u2013 Success depends on unambiguous visual cues.  It out-performed rivals when the target (pineapple, red box) was salient but under-performed when differentiation required reading covers or ignoring occluders (flower book, creeper toy).\n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Robust basic grasp-and-place: quickly secures objects and transports them with minimal jitter (<ref>09836787-40cc-4c82-bc26-f6cf64956336</ref>, <ref>375f5419-ea96-4613-b5d1-800c9738a5be</ref>, <ref>88823fcb-c494-4544-86a1-c3b50604592f</ref>).  \n\u2022 Tool use competence: grasps functional affordances (knife handle, spoon, eraser) and uses them purposefully (<ref>2e88876e-fe12-4017-b3ef-5ae2abe1ae6f</ref>, <ref>3e7d1d6a-9a4e-4cbd-87cf-a46101753fa9</ref>, <ref>533a0161-86c9-4411-8365-72e0f282a92e</ref>, <ref>9efbb5d1-4479-43c4-b1c9-6a0d4f6340cb</ref>).  \n\u2022 Controlled pushing / sliding without unnecessary lifting (<ref>4050abe7-2f99-4582-9688-26c92a10e8da</ref>).  \n\u2022 Selective toppling: knocks only target item, avoiding collateral damage (<ref>041ac340-d55c-4239-b3f9-f1b4ada86095</ref>).  \n\u2022 Able to stack or align objects when tolerance is generous (<ref>ad63e326-3cf1-4833-9e73-11ef7a2fbc82</ref>).  \n\u2022 Scene-aware grasps: often chooses ergonomic handles (mug handle in pouring task <ref>018316ac-98d8-4d40-b973-cc6704e4ff70</ref>).  \n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Frequent \u201cfreeze / no-motion\u201d episodes, especially after perception failures (<ref>005387dc-76ab-405e-b363-b2182a075b5c</ref>, <ref>47c62582-dcaa-430d-abbd-5991b2e1b38f</ref>).  \n\u2022 Fine placement errors: holds object above receptacle but never releases (<ref>2e88876e-fe12-4017-b3ef-5ae2abe1ae6f</ref>, <ref>47e76d78-578a-44a2-bd7c-bcc84616ee1e</ref>).  \n\u2022 Cloth manipulation deficient: mis-grasps or pauses during folding (<ref>3ce0e6ff-f0e9-4a16-991f-c85f4defc92b</ref>, <ref>9efbb5d1-4479-43c4-b1c9-6a0d4f6340cb</ref>).  \n\u2022 Object confusion under color/shape similarity: grabs wrong book (<ref>13e10649-3ae9-45e8-995b-42a1cb27280c</ref>) or wrong utensil (<ref>559e048f-acf7-4225-bb64-1cd903970a38</ref>).  \n\u2022 Multi-step sequences often incomplete, executing first grasp but skipping later action (<ref>1cab0f48-2cbb-485f-b2d6-db7bf5d5b3e4</ref>).  \n\u2022 Precision insertions into narrow openings unreliable (marker-into-bowl, spoon-into-bottle) (<ref>47e76d78-578a-44a2-bd7c-bcc84616ee1e</ref>, <ref>bfb89179-18bb-46b9-a7df-4b4717164243</ref>).\n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Handles simple imperatives well (\u201cput the carrot in the bowl\u201d) but struggles with negation or exclusivity\u2014touched the brush despite \u201cdon\u2019t touch\u201d (<ref>c79ce49d-8246-405c-9199-ca244fdda7d1</ref>).  \n\u2022 Color/position adjectives are usually respected (picked correct brown bowl <ref>375f5419-ea96-4613-b5d1-800c9738a5be</ref>) but sometimes ignored (selected white bowl instead of brown <ref>005387dc-76ab-405e-b363-b2182a075b5c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Relational phrases (\u201cleft duck\u201d, \u201cstack on\u201d, \u201cnext to\u201d) generally successful as in duck-in-cup task (<ref>da901211-e0d2-4bb5-adf4-b6a0196e8b88</ref>).  \n\u2022 Struggles with multi-clause or sequential instructions\u2014often completes first clause only (<ref>1cab0f48-2cbb-485f-b2d6-db7bf5d5b3e4</ref>).  \n\u2022 Robust to mild grammatical errors or lower-case input.\n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning: successfully chooses target among distractors in clutter (picked correct carrot despite many toys <ref>88823fcb-c494-4544-86a1-c3b50604592f</ref>).  Poor when distractor is visually similar or task needs category inference (mistook white book for neural networks book <ref>89e7e745-a740-4a99-8577-3f56814463db</ref>).  \nText reasoning: understands affordances (knew to grip knife handle for \u201ccut\u201d <ref>03919d42-23d1-4dd7-b03c-e066de78103d</ref>), but mis-interprets \u201cpour into tape\u201d (poured into wrong bowl <ref>1d35d057-4813-4334-ac34-cd2a372b3bcd</ref>).  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasping: secure enveloping grasps on bowls, tools, and irregular fruit; rarely drops objects unintentionally.  \n\u2022 Placing: competent for large receptacles; accuracy declines for small-mouth cups or trays.  \n\u2022 Stacking: can balance light blocks or bowls when tolerances are coarse (<ref>167 stack black on white</ref>).  \n\u2022 Insertion: low success rate for pen-into-jar or spoon-into-bottle tasks.  \n\u2022 Pouring / rotation: executed smooth rotation around rim (<ref>018316ac-98d8-4d40-b973-cc6704e4ff70</ref>, <ref>c3d4f82d-cf43-4d6c-83df-70405087178a</ref>).  \n\u2022 Cloth handling: grasps cloth but seldom completes neat fold; draping over large targets acceptable (<ref>cb00af56-1959-4751-a8e0-36905d17ebe7</ref>).  \n\u2022 Recovery: able to re-grasp after initial slip in several episodes, indicating reactive adjustment capability.\n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \nPerformance remains stable under normal lighting and moderate clutter.  It coped with dim scenes (cup-off-bowl, rubber-duck task) but accuracy dropped under very low light (<ref>568e8b89-a14d-46ad-8a7f-54ee3d654965</ref>).  Occlusions in the wrist view rarely derail the policy; it switches to third-person cues.  However, excessive clutter or ambiguous coloration increases wrong-object grasps.\n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 No-motion deadlock after initial camera survey (<ref>47c62582-dcaa-430d-abbd-5991b2e1b38f</ref>).  \n\u2022 Gripping but not releasing over receptacle (<ref>2e88876e-fe12-4017-b3ef-5ae2abe1ae6f</ref>).  \n\u2022 Selecting object of correct type but wrong color/side (<ref>13e10649-3ae9-45e8-995b-42a1cb27280c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Ignoring second clause of multi-step instructions (<ref>1cab0f48-2cbb-485f-b2d6-db7bf5d5b3e4</ref>).  \n\u2022 Cloth mis-grasp leading to stall (<ref>3ce0e6ff-f0e9-4a16-991f-c85f4defc92b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Fine insertion misses mouth of narrow container and then times out (<ref>47e76d78-578a-44a2-bd7c-bcc84616ee1e</ref>).",
        "summary": "- Policy Overview: Vision-language policy; reacts quickly and produces smooth, energy-efficient motions; conservatively halts when uncertain, yielding many ties but few collisions; struggles with fine alignment, multi-step sequencing, and nuanced language; occasionally fails to initiate when perception is shaky.\n\n- Comparative Performance: Generally wins or ties in pick-and-place, tool use, pushing/sliding, and selective toppling; outperformed peers on straightforward retrievals but lost when fine accuracy, cloth folding, narrow insertion, or ambiguous search cues were required; mixed results on open/close tasks, search success tied to target saliency.\n\n- Strengths: Reliable, low-jitter grasp-and-place; purposeful tool use; controlled non-prehensile pushing; knocks only intended targets; succeeds at coarse stacking/alignment; often selects ergonomic handles.\n\n- Weaknesses: Frequent freeze/no-motion after perception failures; holds object without releasing; poor cloth manipulation; confuses look-alike items; skips later steps in multi-stage tasks; low precision in insertions.\n\n- Instruction Following: Executes simple imperatives and most color/relational phrases; robust to minor grammar errors; falters on negation, exclusivity, and multi-clause instructions, often completing only the first clause.\n\n- Reasoning: Handles cluttered scenes and basic affordance reasoning; degrades with visually similar distractors or category inference; grasps tool affordances but sometimes misinterprets subtle goal wording.\n\n- Manipulation Skills: Strong enveloping grasps, rare drops; accurate placement in large receptacles, smooth pouring/rotation; coarse stacking possible; poor on narrow insertions and precise placement; cloth folding weak though draping okay; can re-grasp after slips.\n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Stable under normal lighting, moderate clutter, and dim scenes; tolerates wrist-camera occlusion via alternate views; performance degrades in very low light, heavy clutter, or ambiguous coloration.\n\n- Common Failure Modes: No-motion deadlocks; gripping without release; grabbing correct type but wrong color/side; ignoring later instruction clauses; cloth mis-grasp stalls; repeated narrow-insertion misses leading to timeout.",

            "Session ID: 005387dc-76ab-405e-b363-b2182a075b5c\nTask: put the brown bowl in the purple plate\nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include two third-person views from left and right angles and one top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. The third-person views clearly show the overall environment, the objects on the table, and their relative positions. However, the top-down view from the wrist camera is partially obstructed by the robot's gripper, limiting clear visibility of the target objects and their precise positions.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the brown bowl in the purple plate\" is clear and understandable. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The instruction is straightforward and unambiguous.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a wooden table near a window, with several objects placed on it, including bowls, a purple plate, a drawer-like container, a roll of tape, and a cloth. The brown bowl and purple plate are clearly visible and accessible. There is some clutter, such as the tape roll, cloth, and additional bowls, but these objects are spaced apart enough to not significantly interfere with the task. A person sitting nearby and other background elements are visible but do not directly interfere with the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The brown bowl and purple plate are clearly visible and accessible, and the instruction is straightforward. However, the presence of other objects nearby could require careful manipulation to avoid unintended collisions. Additionally, the partially obstructed wrist camera view may slightly complicate precise positioning and grasping. Overall, the task is manageable but requires careful execution.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_vq_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_vq_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: POlicy A put the white bowl into the purple plate instead of the brown bowl while policy B did not do any thing",

The third-person views clearly show the overall environment, the objects involved, and their relative positions. The top-down view provides a clear and detailed perspective of the objects directly beneath the robot's gripper, making it suitable for precise manipulation tasks.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of all objects. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Move the cup near the plate.\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the object to be manipulated (the cup) and the target location (near the plate). There is no ambiguity or confusion regarding the task.\n\nScene: The scene is set up on a table covered with a cloth, containing several objects including a blue plate, a cup, a cutting board with sliced food, a pot with a lid, a spoon, and additional cups in the background. The cup intended for manipulation is clearly visible and accessible, and the plate is prominently placed on the table. Although there are multiple objects present, they are well-spaced and do not significantly clutter or obstruct the robot's workspace. The cup is upright and easily graspable, and the plate is clearly visible and unobstructed.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The cup is clearly visible, upright, and positioned in an accessible location. The plate is also clearly visible and has ample space around it for placing the cup. The robot does not need to perform highly precise or dexterous manipulation, as the task simply involves picking up the cup and placing it near the plate. The clear visibility, straightforward task description, and lack of significant obstacles or clutter contribute to the overall ease of the task.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_vq_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_vq_droid won\nEvaluation notes: A quickly picked up the cup and moved it near the plate. B kept grasping and releasing the cup instead of lifting it.",
            "Session ID: 018316ac-98d8-4d40-b973-cc6704e4ff70\nTask: Pour the water from the mug into the silver bowl\nTask category: Object Manipulation\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include two third-person views from the left and right sides and one top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. The third-person views clearly show the spatial arrangement of the objects, including the mug and the silver bowl, and provide good context of the environment. The top-down view clearly shows the mug, silver bowl, and another bowl, providing a clear perspective for precise manipulation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and workspace. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Pour the water from the mug into the silver bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the objects involved and the action required, leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene is set up on a clean workspace with minimal clutter. The objects relevant to the task (the mug and silver bowl) are clearly visible and easily accessible. However, there is an additional red bowl present, which could potentially serve as a distractor. The mug is upright and centrally placed, and the silver bowl is positioned conveniently nearby, making the task straightforward. The workspace also includes a computer monitor, keyboard, and other unrelated items, but these are placed away from the immediate task area and should not interfere significantly.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The objects involved (mug and silver bowl) are clearly visible, well-oriented, and placed in close proximity to each other. The mug has a handle, making it easier for the robot to grasp and manipulate.

However, these objects are spaced apart and do not significantly clutter or interfere with the task. The black bowl and white bowl are clearly visible, placed separately, and easily accessible. The bowls are oriented upright, and there are no hidden or obstructed objects that would complicate the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The bowls are clearly visible, well-lit, and placed in an accessible manner. The robot has sufficient space to maneuver, and the bowls are oriented upright, simplifying the grasping and stacking process. The task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making it straightforward to execute.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_vq_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_vq_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Policy a initially headed towards the black bowl but then switched up to white bowl and grabbing it to the edge of the table. Policy B was only moving the white bowl  on top of drawer",
            "Session ID: ff717942-5d20-421c-b1a5-e4ebc4876a53\nTask: unplug the black cable\nTask category: Object Manipulation\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a third-person view and a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. Both angles clearly show the power strip, the black cable plugged into it, and the robot's gripper. The top-down view provides a clear and direct perspective of the plug and socket, which is beneficial for precise manipulation. The third-person view gives a good overview of the workspace and cable arrangement.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or complicate the task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"unplug the black cable\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the action required and identifies the target object by color, leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a wooden table with a power strip placed on a blue cloth. The black cable is clearly plugged into the power strip, and there is also a white cable plugged in, which could potentially cause confusion. Additionally, there are scissors and some loose cables on the table, but these are placed away from the main area of interaction and do not significantly interfere with the task. The black cable is clearly visible, easily accessible, and not obstructed.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The black cable is clearly distinguishable from other objects, and the plug is easily accessible. The robot's gripper is appropriately positioned, and the task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation. The straightforward setup and clear visibility of the target object contribute to the low difficulty level.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_vq_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_vq_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Policy A showed better grasping position compared to policy B. Policy B missed the correct target."

        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npi0_droid is a vision-language manipulation policy that usually produces smooth, deliberate motions and is capable of basic grasp-and-place, pushing, drawer/door manipulation and simple cloth draping.  It tends to rely on coarse visual features: large objects, clear colour cues and obvious affordances (handles, flaps, large openings).  When these cues are present, the policy often completes a task quickly.  Precision skills such as fine grasp alignment, in-hand re-orientation, multi-stage sequencing or disambiguating visually similar items remain limited, and hesitation-loops are common after the first action.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n(Performance is stated relative to the set of competing policies.)  \n\u2022 Cover / Drape / Fold \u2013 pi0_droid was usually preferred: it succeeded in three out of four head-to-head episodes, whereas the comparison policies either froze or misplaced the cloth.  \n\u2022 Open / Close \u2013 Across several drawer, door and box episodes pi0_droid closed or opened the target more reliably and with fewer distractions than rivals; competing policies often hovered or interacted with wrong drawers.  \n\u2022 Move / Slide \u2013 When tasks required a simple push or slide, pi0_droid more frequently completed the motion, while the other policies tended to grasp instead of pushing or abandoned the attempt.  \n\u2022 Group / Organize / Stack \u2013 Successes were slightly more frequent for pi0_droid, but rival policies matched or exceeded it whenever more than two items had to be organised, so the advantage was modest.  \n\u2022 Knock Over / Topple \u2013 The policy under-performed: it often missed the correct object or applied insufficient force, whereas comparison policies toppled the target more consistently.  \n\u2022 Find / Search \u2013 pi0_droid was noticeably weaker: it spent longer exploring or touched the wrong item, while other policies were able to locate or point to the requested object more often.\n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Reliable cloth placement: the rag/newspaper was draped or folded correctly in several scenes (<ref>3ce0e6ff-f0e9-4a16-991f-c85f4defc92b</ref>, <ref>a6fdbff4-b300-4110-b680-df8a33b97a04</ref>, <ref>fd94ab62-98d7-473c-9944-1df05d42fdcd</ref>).  \n\u2022 Drawer & lid manipulation: it closed or opened drawers, doors and boxes smoothly while competitors hesitated (<ref>60dc912d-ad16-46c1-ad5e-6d8b611edc83</ref>, <ref>d2ebd2f2-a807-4be5-a72f-e7ed624659d4</ref>, <ref>d5ba8c7b-3a31-4aa5-934b-b1b8501a3c7e</ref>, <ref>df7e3cec-fbdf-4ae9-89a3-2c4c93dd7b11</ref>).  \n\u2022 Effective pushing / sliding: completed dust-pan, ball-and-cup and dustpan pushes with single decisive motions (<ref>bc84dde3-b274-4256-b532-38d608875f41</ref>, <ref>934888cd-305e-4281-9d33-b34da4f4ba04</ref>, <ref>fbf7c2ae-f821-4091-bbfd-1bd34757035b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Smooth, low-jerk trajectories on some pick-and-place episodes, giving quicker completion than peers (<ref>2b63766e-3fe0-4198-bfdd-cf7c4cb23b7b</ref>, <ref>097acd46-2c04-4eb8-99a0-424df7ff44a1</ref>).  \n\u2022 Handles clutter moderately well when the goal object is visually salient; e.g., retrieving a doll among nearby items (<ref>16e5bbda-57c1-4e58-a24a-b39ee8142d41</ref>).\n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Object search & localisation: frequently failed in \u201ctouch / point / find\u201d tasks, wandering or selecting wrong items (<ref>4cdf7321-f9ad-4a9d-8529-cf7cc08b6f20</ref>, <ref>6e4a029a-24a3-4d7e-beca-88d8d439ed26</ref>, <ref>d80e7555-39aa-44e3-8858-333a5034b07b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Knock-over actions inconsistent\u2014either hit the supporting object or applied too little force (<ref>041ac340-d55c-4239-b3f9-f1b4ada86095</ref>, <ref>379e00ab-f6a8-4a48-8d0b-e04378d95a74</ref>).  \n\u2022 Fine manipulation / slender objects: missed or dropped tape rolls, markers, tissues, ketchup bottle etc. (<ref>3a93f1c7-bf5f-47c0-821b-8ba001112216</ref>, <ref>8b5f086f-39b9-4628-aa8f-63446b5085e4</ref>, <ref>f5193ce5-8de1-4c27-8f46-6601f6e36f02</ref>).  \n\u2022 Colour & identity confusions: wrong-colour cup, marker, duck or bowl chosen in multiple episodes (<ref>69f9098b-86c9-419e-9c4b-75f8ae7f7525</ref>, <ref>40dc1e54-9b74-4774-8019-9ca4395f1ecb</ref>, <ref>3a663fc7-15b1-4993-b5b8-b059fd197d91</ref>).  \n\u2022 Multi-step tasks often stall after first sub-goal\u2014e.g., unstacking cups but never inserting carrot (<ref>8890c219-753d-42ea-9f30-3348ac94ae4c</ref>) or moving only one item in a \u201cplace all items\u201d task (<ref>107cb4bf-2e5a-46e1-84c1-f45467de56e6</ref>).\n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Handles direct, single-verb imperatives well (e.g., \u201cpush dustpan right\u201d <ref>bc84dde3-b274-4256-b532-38d608875f41</ref>).  \n\u2022 Struggles with relational or attribute qualifiers: picked a purple marker instead of the requested green (<ref>40dc1e54-9b74-4774-8019-9ca4395f1ecb</ref>) and a wrong-colour cup (<ref>69f9098b-86c9-419e-9c4b-75f8ae7f7525</ref>).  \n\u2022 Sensitive to wording ambiguity: mis-interpreted \u201cclean up the table\u201d by moving only one tissue while ignoring the bin (<ref>cbf7d078-efda-46d1-b203-6b7b0fd84da9</ref>).  \n\u2022 Negated or conditional phrases are rarely followed; in \u201cdo absolutely nothing\u201d it moved anyway (<ref>25c0a175-ad1c-468e-b55e-e1029f26d94e</ref>).  \n\u2022 Minor typos in prompts seldom harm performance (e.g., understood \u201cdoll in bag\u201d <ref>16e5bbda-57c1-4e58-a24a-b39ee8142d41</ref>).\n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning strengths  \n\u2022 Correctly inferred that the drawer handle, not the front panel, must be contacted (<ref>d2ebd2f2-a807-4be5-a72f-e7ed624659d4</ref>).  \n\u2022 Recognised that the silver bowl, not the distractor red bowl, was the target (<ref>1e1ddded-c37d-432f-b5c0-838e38fce94a</ref>).  \n\nReasoning weaknesses  \n\u2022 Failed to map \u201cshelf on your right\u201d and never oriented towards it (<ref>d64cd397-c24e-4b8f-9697-5218c2ca762c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Could not deduce multi-step order\u2014placed cloth in silver bowl instead of draping first (<ref>a6fdbff4-b300-4110-b680-df8a33b97a04</ref>).  \n\u2022 Often ignores size constraints (tried to fit a plate into a cup <ref>934888cd-305e-4281-9d33-b34da4f4ba04</ref>).\n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasping large rigid objects is reliable (blocks, bowls, dolls) (<ref>48360ef7-487f-456e-91a8-3de64b165d4d</ref>, <ref>1e2a967e-5ac2-45b0-a2ac-0002a43f10a9</ref>).  \n\u2022 Push interactions are forceful yet controlled, rarely overshooting (<ref>fbf7c2ae-f821-4091-bbfd-1bd34757035b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Drawer closing executed with good alignment and full range motion (<ref>60dc912d-ad16-46c1-ad5e-6d8b611edc83</ref>).  \n\u2022 Fine grasp alignment poor: missed tissue (<ref>f5193ce5-8de1-4c27-8f46-6601f6e36f02</ref>) and ketchup bottle slipped (<ref>8b5f086f-39b9-4628-aa8f-63446b5085e4</ref>).  \n\u2022 Release timing issues\u2014often holds after goal state (lid on pot, marker in bowl) (<ref>0104e304-97be-4f8b-a0af-064a27dcf596</ref>, <ref>24f3883a-d9a9-4351-ba8a-df85ab678168</ref>).  \n\u2022 Cloth folding is partial: grips edges but seldom completes a second fold (<ref>fd94ab62-98d7-473c-9944-1df05d42fdcd</ref>).\n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \n\u2022 Performs under dim or uneven lighting when the goal object has distinctive colour (e.g., purple plate tasks in low light <ref>07fbba6f-3409-48b5-964a-614b72cc0cac</ref>).  \n\u2022 Handles moderate background clutter, succeeding even with shelves and cables nearby (<ref>e0f7ee84-36d9-417c-be68-90fac2ea5a43</ref>).  \n\u2022 Sensitive to heavy occlusion or very dark scenes: failed when the main object blended into shadows (<ref>3a663fc7-15b1-4993-b5b8-b059fd197d91</ref>).  \n\u2022 Wrist-camera occlusions (gripper blocking view) often lead to hesitation (<ref>f7d2dba0-971c-41d9-9d44-28c7b44ef57b</ref>).\n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Freezing / oscillation after first motion (<ref>18d95f1f-0c8f-4746-b2f5-aa1c5edfcfd0</ref>, <ref>25c0a175-ad1c-468e-b55e-e1029f26d94e</ref>).  \n\u2022 Grabbing wrong item of similar colour or shape (<ref>69f9098b-86c9-419e-9c4b-75f8ae7f7525</ref>, <ref>40dc1e54-9b74-4774-8019-9ca4395f1ecb</ref>).  \n\u2022 Dropping object mid-transfer, then failing to recover (<ref>8890c219-753d-42ea-9f30-3348ac94ae4c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Never releasing after successful placement (<ref>0104e304-97be-4f8b-a0af-064a27dcf596</ref>).  \n\u2022 Insufficient force in knock-over tasks\u2014light touch without topple (<ref>379e00ab-f6a8-4a48-8d0b-e04378d95a74</ref>).  \n\u2022 Ignoring negations / \u201cdo nothing\u201d instructions, leading to unwanted movement (<ref>25c0a175-ad1c-468e-b55e-e1029f26d94e</ref>).",
        "summary": "- Policy Overview: Vision-language policy; smooth, deliberate motions for basic grasp-place, push, door/drawer and simple cloth work; depends on coarse colour/shape cues; limited fine alignment, in-hand re-orientation and multi-step sequencing; hesitation loops common after first action.\n\n- Comparative Performance: Leads on drape/fold, open/close and push/slide tasks; modest edge on small organise/stack scenes; clearly lags on knock-over/topple and find/search episodes.\n\n- Strengths: Consistent cloth placement, smooth drawer/box manipulation, decisive controlled pushes, low-jerk trajectories, handles moderate clutter when target is visually salient.\n\n- Weaknesses: Poor localisation/search, unreliable knock-over force, difficulty with slender/fine objects, frequent colour/identity mix-ups, multi-step tasks often stall after initial sub-goal.\n\n- Instruction Following: Executes simple imperative verbs well; struggles with relational or attribute qualifiers, ambiguous phrasing and negations/conditionals; minor typos rarely harmful.\n\n- Reasoning: Correctly selects functional affordances and filters some distractors; fails with spatial language (\u201con your right\u201d), ordering of multi-step goals and size feasibility checks.\n\n- Manipulation Skills: Reliable grasps on large rigid items, controlled pushing and accurate drawer closure; weak fine-grip alignment, release timing and completion of full cloth folds.\n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Works under dim lighting and moderate clutter; performance drops with heavy occlusion, very dark scenes or self-occlusion from the wrist camera.\n\n- Common Failure Modes: Freezing/oscillation after first move, grabbing wrong similar item, dropping then not recovering, holding without release, insufficient topple force, acting despite \u201cdo nothing\u201d instructions.",

            "Session ID: 005387dc-76ab-405e-b363-b2182a075b5c\nTask: put the brown bowl in the purple plate\nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera and two third-person views from left and right angles. The third-person views clearly show the objects and their arrangement on the table, providing good spatial context. However, the wrist camera's top-down view is somewhat limited, showing only a partial view of the objects, making it less effective for clearly identifying the target objects and their relative positions.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, with no significant shadows or glares that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task. The objects and their colors are clearly distinguishable, and the environment is well-lit.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the brown bowl in the purple plate\" is clear and understandable. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The instruction is straightforward and unambiguous.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a long table near a window, with several objects placed on it, including bowls, plates, tape, and cloth. The brown bowl and purple plate are clearly visible and identifiable. However, there are multiple distractor objects present, such as additional bowls, tape, and cloth, which could potentially interfere with the robot's manipulation task. The objects are spaced apart, reducing the likelihood of accidental collisions or confusion, but the presence of multiple objects still adds complexity.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately easy. The target objects (brown bowl and purple plate) are clearly visible and accessible, and the instruction is straightforward. However, the presence of distractor objects slightly increases the complexity, requiring the robot to accurately identify and grasp the correct bowl without disturbing other items. The manipulation itself does not seem to require highly precise or dexterous movements, making the overall difficulty manageable.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_droid won\nEvaluation notes: POlicy A put the white bowl into the purple plate instead of the brown bowl while policy B did not do any thing",

Both angles clearly show the board, the eraser, and the markings that need to be erased. The top-down view is particularly helpful for precise manipulation, clearly showing the eraser's position relative to the markings.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the board, eraser, and markings. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder observation or task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"erase the board\" is clear, concise, and unambiguous. It is written in lowercase letters, but this does not affect the clarity or understanding of the task. There are no spelling or grammatical mistakes.\n\nScene: The scene setup is simple and uncluttered, consisting of a white board with clear black markings and a single eraser placed near the markings. There are no distractors or unnecessary objects that could interfere with the task. The eraser is oriented clearly and is easily accessible for the robot to grasp and manipulate.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The setup is straightforward, with clear visibility, good lighting, and no clutter or distractors. The eraser is conveniently placed near the markings, and the markings themselves are simple and clearly visible. The robot should be able to execute this task without requiring highly precise or dexterous manipulation.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy B\nResult: pi0_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Both policy A and policy B were hesistant but policy A showed more redundant and repetitive actions.

The third-person views provide a general overview of the scene, clearly showing the table, plate, fork, bread, and cup. The top-down view clearly shows the precise positions and orientations of the fork, plate, and other objects, making it suitable for accurately executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is insufficient and dim, creating shadows and dark areas that reduce visibility. The objects, especially the fork and plate, are somewhat difficult to distinguish clearly due to the low lighting conditions. This dim lighting could make the task harder to observe and complete accurately.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Place the fork to the right of the plate.\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There is no ambiguity regarding what the robot is expected to do, and the instructions are straightforward.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a table covered with a checkered tablecloth, a plate, a fork, two pieces of bread, and a cup. The fork is currently placed to the left of the plate, clearly visible and accessible. The bread and cup are not directly interfering with the task, but their presence adds minor clutter. The environment around the table has some unnecessary objects and clutter, but these are not directly interfering with the task execution.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. While the task itself is straightforward and clearly defined, the dim lighting conditions and shadows may pose challenges for accurate perception and manipulation. The fork is clearly visible and accessible, and the required manipulation is relatively simple, but the poor lighting conditions could complicate the robot's ability to precisely grasp and reposition the fork.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_droid won\nEvaluation notes: A missed grabbing at first but then came back and picked up the fork. A then moved the fork to the right but ran out of time before it could let go. B was confused and then tried to pick up the knife (but failed to do so).",

However, the presence of other objects like the stapler and additional markers could potentially serve as distractors.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The objects involved (green marker and notebook) are clearly visible and accessible, and the action required (placing the marker on the notebook) is straightforward. However, the presence of other objects nearby could slightly complicate the task by requiring careful navigation and precise manipulation to avoid unintended interactions. Overall, the task seems manageable but requires moderate precision and spatial awareness.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy B\nResult: pi0_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: Both policies did not do well here since they were asked to do task with the green marker and ended up picking up the purple marker instead. Policy A also froze towards the end and policy B continously moved around during the runtime.",
            "Session ID: fd94ab62-98d7-473c-9944-1df05d42fdcd\nTask: Fold the rag.\nTask category: Cover / Drape / Fold\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include two third-person views from the left and right sides and one top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. The third-person views provide a clear overview of the workspace, the table, and the rag's position. The top-down view clearly shows the rag and the robot's gripper, providing a good perspective for precise manipulation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is somewhat dim, creating shadows and darker areas around the workspace. The rag is still visible, but the dim lighting could potentially make precise manipulation slightly more challenging. There are no significant glares, but improved lighting would enhance visibility.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Fold the rag.\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There is no ambiguity regarding what the robot is expected to do.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a checkered tablecloth-covered table with a green rag placed flat on top. The rag is clearly visible, unfolded, and oriented in a straightforward manner. The workspace is relatively uncluttered, although there are some objects and boxes in the background and sides of the scene. These background objects do not directly interfere with the task but could potentially distract the robot's perception system.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately easy. The rag is clearly visible, flat, and well-positioned on the table, making it accessible for manipulation. However, the dim lighting conditions and background clutter could slightly increase the difficulty, requiring the robot to accurately perceive and manipulate the rag despite these minor challenges. Overall, the task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making it relatively straightforward.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy B\nResult: pi0_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Policy B grabbed both sides of the rag and made a motion to fold but quit part of the way through. A did not successfully grasp the rag at all.",
            "Session ID: fef6e9a7-32d1-47b6-b8b3-710c3a0a2839\nTask: put the staple remover on the cloth\nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a clear top-down view from the robot's wrist camera and two third-person views from left and right angles. These angles collectively offer a comprehensive view of the staple remover, the cloth, and the surrounding environment, making it easy to understand the spatial relationships and positions of the objects involved in the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is bright and evenly distributed, providing good visibility of the objects and workspace. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder observation or task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the staple remover on the cloth\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the objects involved and the action required, leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a countertop with a cloth clearly visible and neatly placed. The staple remover is positioned close to the cloth, clearly visible and easily accessible. However, the countertop and surrounding area contain several unrelated objects, such as cables, containers, and miscellaneous items, which could potentially serve as distractors. Despite this, the staple remover and cloth are clearly distinguishable and not obstructed or hidden.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The staple remover is clearly visible, oriented in a way that makes it easy to grasp, and placed close to the cloth. The cloth is flat and easily accessible, providing a clear target area for placing the staple remover. The presence of some clutter in the environment slightly increases complexity, but overall, the task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making it straightforward to execute.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy B\nResult: pi0_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: Both policies did poorly as they were unable to identify the staple remover, which was located on the left. In both trials as Policy A approached the grey stapler and policy B tried to reach the red stapler on top right of the scene.",
            "Session ID: fff333cb-b6aa-4bb1-815a-be4506907c6b\nTask: Dump out the grey tray.\nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include two third-person views from the left and right cameras and one top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. The third-person views clearly show the overall environment, objects, and their arrangement on the table, providing good context for the task. The top-down view from the wrist camera clearly shows the grey tray, which is the target object, and its immediate surroundings, making it suitable for precise manipulation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder observation or task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"Dump out the grey tray.\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the action required and identifies the target object (grey tray), leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a table covered with a cloth, on which several objects are placed, including the grey tray, a cutting board, a cardboard box, a drill, and other miscellaneous items. There are additional objects on the side and floor, but they are not directly interfering with the task. The grey tray is clearly visible, placed on the cutting board, and easily accessible. Although there are multiple objects present, they are spaced apart sufficiently, minimizing the risk of interference or confusion during task execution.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The grey tray is clearly visible, well-oriented, and placed in an accessible position on the cutting board. The robot has sufficient space to grasp and manipulate the tray without obstruction. The task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making it straightforward to execute successfully.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_droid won\nEvaluation notes: A grasped the grey tray but then let go, not progressing further. B only pushed the grey tray to the side a bit, never grasping it. Both seemed to struggle to understand what the task was asking of them."

        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npaligemma_diffusion_droid is a vision-language manipulation policy that routinely finds and grasps medium-size objects, moves them along fairly smooth Cartesian paths, and completes many \u201csingle-object-into-container\u201d tasks without human intervention.  It shows above-average performance when a single salient target is presented in good lighting and little fine orientation is needed.  However, the policy becomes hesitant when precision alignment, multi-step sequencing, or strong negative constraints are required, and it often terminates actions prematurely (hovering while still holding the object).  Scene understanding is largely reactive\u2014good enough to pick and place in uncluttered views, but prone to confusion when distractors, small handles, or poor lighting are introduced.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\u2022 Tool Use \u2013 Consistently stronger than peers.  In almost every wiping, flipping, or stirring task paligemma beat or tied the opponent while the other policies either froze or grasped the wrong tool (e.g., wiped beans with a cloth when the competitor never moved <ref>1910d9d3-813c-4b1b-ab94-0401000ad25c</ref>, grasped the board-wiper and approached the whiteboard while the rival dropped it <ref>98f2404f-b859-4397-8c82-6af577fd20a8</ref>, stirred the pot whereas the opponent never found the spoon <ref>c4645961-8cc6-4b89-b564-5ccbf482134e</ref>).  \n\u2022 Knock Over / Topple \u2013 Outperformed rivals on simple pushes (e.g., knocked a cup over while the competitor stayed still <ref>45502707-02fe-4c84-8363-2adead3e2174</ref>), but produced only parity on more demanding pushes and occasionally under-pushed objects that competitors moved farther (<ref>e6f1009b-33c2-49e6-a85d-b5f4b3df6039</ref>).  \n\u2022 Pick and Place \u2013 Performance is average: wins on straightforward container drops (e.g., cup into cabinet <ref>52f92f35-ede5-418b-bde4-3637235944c7</ref>) are balanced by losses when color, left/right, or multiple sequential steps matter (ducks-into-cups, competitor finished both sides while paligemma dropped the second duck).  \n\u2022 Open / Close \u2013 Mixed.  It cleanly closed doors or jars faster than other agents (<ref>05a417df-0ea1-4e50-8eec-c900b6494747</ref>, <ref>468317b5-1146-46ed-b52c-e1f634972279</ref>) but frequently lost on drawers with small handles where another policy managed at least a partial pull (<ref>29f138ba-a77d-4b00-8b73-4e82f20e5178</ref>, <ref>c154c0a7-ec0a-4128-aa32-cf844ca3885e</ref>).  \n\u2022 Cover / Drape / Fold \u2013 Generally worse than competitors.  It lost or tied on most folding/draping episodes where the other policy executed a cleaner or more complete drape (<ref>2bfd8160-596a-4ea8-8aab-61995be0f37b</ref>, <ref>78200768-4286-40a7-8580-e5864e341721</ref>).  \n\u2022 Move / Slide \u2013 Consistently under-performed.  It failed to push the mouse, cup, or clipper while opponents completed or nearly completed the slide (<ref>43b0190d-e747-4f92-b8d4-072bc727a220</ref>, <ref>1537083d-55dd-421b-89e4-dcc48846928a</ref>).  \n\u2022 Find / Search \u2013 Weaker than peers.  In several \u201ctouch / point / find\u201d tasks the policy looked in the wrong direction or touched the wrong sign while the competing agent succeeded (<ref>6c4e72b0-850f-4bd1-8d19-691db2f23349</ref>, <ref>a1878b1c-5355-4e08-96ca-53700dffcf17</ref>).\n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Robust single-object grasp and container placement: reliably lifts items such as cups, bottles, spoons, or ducks and drops them into visible receptacles (<ref>52f92f35-ede5-418b-bde4-3637235944c7</ref>, <ref>37778af3-2b6c-4b66-a28c-c8c0ec08b481</ref>).  \n\u2022 Effective tool use: wipes tables with a cloth (<ref>1910d9d3-813c-4b1b-ab94-0401000ad25c</ref>), erases whiteboards with a wiper (<ref>98f2404f-b859-4397-8c82-6af577fd20a8</ref>), flips bread with a spatula (<ref>0d2a3df8-3ad4-4047-96d0-8732cec02c39</ref>), and stabs bread with a chopstick (<ref>6f4b9736-58ec-4adf-b2ac-40c2bab03e28</ref>).  \n\u2022 Smooth, collision-free trajectories in uncluttered work-spaces, e.g., cable-into-basket episode where it out-scored the rival on motion quality despite not finishing (<ref>2bed5443-cc21-4cf4-951d-457563f78924</ref>).  \n\u2022 Can tolerate minor spelling errors (\u201cbusket\u201d) and still complete the task (<ref>e8f5d5ff-5fa3-497d-ae23-05a9951f7654</ref>).\n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Color or object-class confusion in clutter: grasps wrong item (clear cup knocked over instead of picked up <ref>3ebe11bd-37f5-4b6e-9abe-30e796d413a6</ref>, stapler instead of pen <ref>ab0c3a1a-b5d5-4f1f-817f-6d1f22ef3a90</ref>).  \n\u2022 Poor performance on fabric manipulation and draping tasks \u2013 drops cloth early or barely covers target (<ref>2bfd8160-596a-4ea8-8aab-61995be0f37b</ref>, <ref>78200768-4286-40a7-8580-e5864e341721</ref>).  \n\u2022 Fails to operate small handles or slide drawers fully closed/open (partial pulls then freeze) (<ref>514bf697-7324-40fe-8c8c-6c7b3ee8f870</ref>, <ref>c154c0a7-ec0a-4128-aa32-cf844ca3885e</ref>).  \n\u2022 Limited compliance with negative instructions \u2013 touched the forbidden spoon despite explicit prohibition (<ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>).  \n\u2022 Frequent failure to release or fully finish after grasp (plant held above bowl without release <ref>fe57eae1-8c14-4ffa-8284-aa87cf0251c3</ref>; tray hovering beside bigger tray <ref>c5e62dc1-3a58-423c-9f66-0a02f126b78f</ref>).\n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Handles simple imperative commands reliably (e.g., \u201cput the cup in the cabinet\u201d <ref>52f92f35-ede5-418b-bde4-3637235944c7</ref>).  \n\u2022 Tolerant of typos and lowercase (\u201cbusket\u201d episode completed) <ref>e8f5d5ff-5fa3-497d-ae23-05a9951f7654</ref>.  \n\u2022 Struggles with negation or prohibitions (touched spoon when told \u201cdo not touch the spoon\u201d <ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>).  \n\u2022 Multi-step or sequenced instructions often only partially done (bread placed on lid instead of into pot first <ref>1cab0f48-2cbb-485f-b2d6-db7bf5d5b3e4</ref>; carrot inserted but lid never closed <ref>68fe1184-6439-44a6-8b01-0750ebac0abf</ref>).  \n\u2022 Relative spatial phrases (\u201cnext to\u201d, \u201cleft/right\u201d) frequently mis-interpreted (ball placed off-target <ref>ab0c0fc7-fc6e-4238-a969-7edb65d9f110</ref>; left/right duck task lost <ref>685b75e5-39c9-4e67-994d-d892ddda61c0</ref>).\n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene context: Good at inferring container affordances\u2014selects bowls, cabinets, or drawers as deposition sites even when several receptacles are present (<ref>37778af3-2b6c-4b66-a28c-c8c0ec08b481</ref>).  \nDeficiencies arise with occluded or poorly lit handles where it repeatedly probes wrong surfaces (<ref>6c4e72b0-850f-4bd1-8d19-691db2f23349</ref>).  \nText reasoning: Properly ignores spelling errors but fails to parse multi-clause temporal ordering (\u201cthen\u201d, \u201cafter\u201d) leading to reversed or skipped steps (<ref>68fe1184-6439-44a6-8b01-0750ebac0abf</ref>).  \nLogical negation is not internalized, leading to safety-critical mistakes (<ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>).\n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasping: high success on medium-size rigid objects; rarely knocks them over during approach (<ref>37778af3-2b6c-4b66-a28c-c8c0ec08b481</ref>).  \n\u2022 Placing & stacking: succeeds on single-level stacking (cup-on-cup pyramid <ref>bc815a77-5d9f-46c9-857f-34d116954cac</ref>) but often under-lifts heavy trays, bumping the rim (<ref>c5e62dc1-3a58-423c-9f66-0a02f126b78f</ref>).  \n\u2022 Tool use: grasps handles naturally and executes gross motions (wiping, stirring, stabbing) without excessive oscillation (<ref>c4645961-8cc6-4b89-b564-5ccbf482134e</ref>).  \n\u2022 Release strategy is brittle; objects linger in gripper or are dropped outside target (<ref>fe57eae1-8c14-4ffa-8284-aa87cf0251c3</ref>).  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \n\u2022 Handles moderate tabletop clutter and still locates primary objects (screwdriver among distractors <ref>70265d9f-b4d7-4033-a300-27b29f122af8</ref>).  \n\u2022 Performance degrades sharply under poor lighting\u2014fails colour classification and mis-targets (dim \u201cpoint at kettle\u201d scene <ref>6c4e72b0-850f-4bd1-8d19-691db2f23349</ref>; dark bolt-in-box task <ref>5a89344f-76e3-4bf7-9641-27934b3489f2</ref>).  \n\u2022 Sensitive to wrist-camera occlusion; when the handle is hidden by its own gripper the policy stalls (drawer episodes <ref>29f138ba-a77d-4b00-8b73-4e82f20e5178</ref>).  \n\u2022 Tolerates minor spelling noise and modest distractor counts but not heavy occlusion or very tight workspaces.\n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Picks or pushes the wrong but similarly coloured object (<ref>3ebe11bd-37f5-4b6e-9abe-30e796d413a6</ref>).  \n\u2022 Freezes mid-trajectory after grasp, hovering indefinitely (<ref>70d3d182-d4fd-405a-ac2b-5476e575195c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Never releases object even after reaching target (<ref>fe57eae1-8c14-4ffa-8284-aa87cf0251c3</ref>).  \n\u2022 Repetitive micro-motions around drawers or handles without exerting force (<ref>514bf697-7324-40fe-8c8c-6c7b3ee8f870</ref>).  \n\u2022 Ignores explicit prohibitions, executing the forbidden action anyway (<ref>60047c46-a615-45c2-aedd-8021277c6152</ref>).  \n\u2022 Under-pushing in topple tasks\u2014makes contact but leaves object standing (<ref>e6f1009b-33c2-49e6-a85d-b5f4b3df6039</ref>).",
        "summary": "- Policy Overview: Vision-language agent reliably grasps and deposits single medium objects via smooth, collision-free paths; strong when target is salient, lighting good, and precision low. Hesitates on fine alignment, multi-step sequences, or negative constraints, often stopping while still holding the item. Reactive perception; distractors, small handles, or dim scenes cause confusion.\n\n- Comparative Performance: Best-in-class tool use; above peers on simple knock/topple. Average on basic pick-and-place; mixed on open/close (good with doors, jars; poor with small handles). Worse than rivals on drape/fold, move/slide, and find/search tasks.\n\n- Strengths: Reliable single-object grasp and container drop; competent wiping, stirring, flipping with tools; smooth, collision-free motions; tolerates minor spelling errors.\n\n- Weaknesses: Frequent color/object mix-ups in clutter, poor fabric handling, struggles with small handles/drawers, ignores negative commands, and often fails to release after grasp.\n\n- Instruction Following: Executes simple imperatives and typo-laden text, but mishandles negations, multi-step or temporal instructions, and left/right or \u201cnext to\u201d spatial references.\n\n- Reasoning: Correctly infers container affordances; falters with occluded or poorly lit features. Parses simple text, ignores typos, yet fails on multi-clause orderings and logical negation, leading to safety-critical errors.\n\n- Manipulation Skills: High grasp success on medium rigid objects, basic stacking, natural tool trajectories; release unreliable and heavy items or tray lifts commonly bump or stall.\n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Works through moderate clutter and spelling noise; performance drops sharply with poor lighting, gripper-camera occlusion, heavy occlusion, or tight workspaces.\n\n- Common Failure Modes: Selects wrong similarly colored object, freezes mid-motion, never releases after reaching goal, dithers at handles, ignores prohibitions, and under-pushes in topple tasks.",

            "Session ID: 017ea417-3191-4f51-a81d-64519d969829\nTask: pick up red cube and put it in green bowl \nTask category: Pick and Place\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a third-person angled view and a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera. Both views clearly show the red cube and green bowl, providing sufficient visual information for the robot to execute the task. The top-down view is particularly helpful for precise positioning and grasping.\n\nLighting: The lighting is generally adequate, illuminating the objects and workspace clearly. However, there is a noticeable glare or reflection on the surface in the top-down view, which could slightly affect visual perception. Despite this, the objects remain clearly distinguishable, and the glare does not significantly hinder task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up red cube and put it in green bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the objects involved and the required action, leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected behavior.\n\nScene: The scene setup is simple and uncluttered, consisting primarily of a red cube and a green bowl placed on a perforated black surface. There are no significant distractors or unnecessary objects that could interfere with the task. Both objects are clearly visible, easily identifiable, and positioned in a straightforward manner, facilitating easy manipulation.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The simplicity of the scene, clear visibility of the objects, and straightforward nature of the task (picking up a clearly visible cube and placing it into an open bowl) suggest minimal difficulty. The cube is well-oriented and easily graspable, and the bowl is open and accessible, requiring no complex or precise manipulation.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_diffusion_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_diffusion_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: Both policies completed the task in almost the same time limit",

The third-person views clearly show the table, objects, and surrounding environment, providing good spatial context. However, the top-down wrist camera view is partially obstructed by the robot's gripper, limiting visibility of the objects directly beneath it, which could hinder precise manipulation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is generally sufficient, with natural illumination clearly showing the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows or glares that would negatively impact the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the black bottle on the blue bowl\" is clear and understandable. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The objects mentioned (black bottle and blue bowl) are clearly identifiable in the images.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a table with several objects present, including the target objects (a black bottle and a blue bowl) and additional distractor objects (another container, a tube, and miscellaneous items). The blue bowl is clearly visible and accessible, and the black bottle is placed upright and easily reachable. Although there are distractors, they are spaced apart and unlikely to significantly interfere with the task execution.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The objects involved (black bottle and blue bowl) are clearly visible, well-separated, and easily accessible. However, the partial obstruction in the wrist camera view could slightly complicate precise grasping and placement. Overall, the task does not require highly dexterous manipulation or precise alignment, making it relatively straightforward to complete.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_diffusion_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_diffusion_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Policy A did better. Policy B predicted the first movement surrounding the blue bowl, which should not be the first object we are looking for. The black bottle was located on the left side of the table. Policy A completed the whole task very quickly",

The third-person views clearly show the overall environment and object placement, while the top-down view provides a clear and detailed perspective of the objects directly beneath the robot's gripper, making it suitable for precise manipulation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or complicate the task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up the yellow duck on the left and put it in the red cup\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly specifies the object to manipulate (yellow duck on the left) and the target location (red cup), leaving no ambiguity.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a clean, uncluttered white table surface. Objects present include two yellow ducks, one red cup, one orange lobster-shaped object, and a few metallic kitchen utensils. The yellow ducks are clearly visible and well-separated, making it easy to identify the duck on the left. The red cup is upright and easily accessible. The presence of the lobster-shaped object and metallic utensils could serve as minor distractors, but they are sufficiently spaced apart and unlikely to significantly interfere with the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The objects involved (yellow duck and red cup) are clearly visible, well-separated, and easily accessible. The duck is small but simple in shape, and the cup is stable and open, making placement straightforward. The minor distractors present are unlikely to cause confusion or difficulty, and the clear camera angles and good lighting further simplify the task execution.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_diffusion_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_diffusion_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: Policy A put both ducks in the cup, the command was to only put 1 in, policy b picked up the wrong duck, dropped it, then when attempting to put it in the cup, it missed the cup",
