        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npi0_fast_droid is a vision-language manipulation policy that generally produces smooth, decisive arm motions and can re-plan when the first attempt fails.  It excels at single\u2013object pick-and-place or simple attribute-based selections (e.g., \u201cnon-red object\u201d), but its performance degrades when the instruction demands fine-alignment, multi-step sequencing, or subtle object discrimination (similar colors, multiple identical items).  The controller occasionally stalls for long intervals and shows limited vertical exploration, leading to time-outs on shelf or drawer tasks.  Overall behaviour is competent but still brittle to clutter, ambiguous colour cues, and precision placement.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \nOverall record across 62 head-to-head episodes: 32 wins / 19 losses / 11 ties (\u2248 52 % win-rate).  \n\u2022 Wins cluster on straightforward containment or relocation tasks (place X in Y) and colour-filtering commands, while losses concentrate on precision assemblies, multi-object clean-ups, and tasks requiring opening/closing mechanisms.  \n\u2022 Against frozen or hesitant baselines it often secures a \u201ctechnical\u201d win by simply acting, but it seldom achieves a perfect success state\u2014many wins are partial (object dropped near, not in, the target).  \n\nDetailed comparative insights  \n\u2013 Repeatedly out-performed peers on simple fruit/vegetable pick-and-place: pineapple to bowl <ref>7a84d536-013e-4ad0-9c5d-ea3be1e9474c</ref>, cloth to bowl <ref>2a6b9acf-1e66-4312-9d23-bfa0824337fe</ref>, wired-mouse task <ref>a5247f6a-461d-4388-b35d-ed65a1e7dfc6</ref>.  \n\u2013 Showed robust colour-filter reasoning, beating the competitor on \u201cnon-red object\u201d selection <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref> and \u201call red items\u201d gathering <ref>00d2b265-f7fd-409d-8b09-3112db0046d2</ref>.  \n\u2013 Lost consistently when precise placement mattered: tape into red plate mis-positioned <ref>3c07a309-0dee-4aa9-b4de-df990dd06e26</ref>, cube stacking <ref>7b034400-d225-4d3d-be8e-462f6fcb83d0</ref>, tape \u2192 black bowl long-distance throw <ref>84319d8a-6873-470d-b23f-aeb4d6107520</ref>.  \n\u2013 Competitor dominated high-dexterity assemblies: Jenga alignment advantage to baseline although pi0_fast_droid still \u201cwon\u201d via time-out <ref>585c87a3-3e01-49ab-b8ad-28684e40949a</ref>.  \n\u2013 Multi-item planning weak: froze after first object in \u201cplace all items\u201d task, while rival continued <ref>08d3d301-7027-418b-9fe7-e11b1a23c624</ref>.  \n\u2013 Manipulating drawers or lids: policy won partial drawer-opening <ref>0a25f1d8-f70c-4665-a1d2-9ef150eaf466</ref> but lost on closing wet-wipes lid <ref>9c2b29f5-7825-4c22-b4ff-0095cd7fbb29</ref> and closing kitchen drawer <ref>60dc912d-ad16-46c1-ad5e-6d8b611edc83</ref>.  \n\u2013 Frequently beat rival simply by moving while the other froze (e.g., bowl into drawer <ref>efa9835e-e6f0-4b4e-b29e-c10f611a6447</ref>, pineapple placement <ref>e8dc673d-c7b1-415a-94e3-2b238588caed</ref>).  \n\u2013 Lost shelf-height or vertical-reach tasks where exploration above table height was required (plant on bookshelf <ref>f80985e2-fda2-40c8-9a1c-e84e26693ceb</ref>, portafilter removal <ref>0a22cb51-9c64-43eb-948a-b795ce51edd0</ref>).  \n\nKey comparative take-aways  \n\u2022 Superior on single-step, table-top pick-and-place; inferior on precision stacking, pouring, or multi-stage clean-ups.  \n\u2022 Colour and simple negation language handled better than competitor; geometric reasoning (exact pose, height differences) weaker.  \n\u2022 Often gains wins by being active rather than accurate; quality gap visible in fine success metrics.  \n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Smooth trajectory generation and ability to re-grasp after first miss, e.g., second-attempt pineapple drop succeeded after self-adjustment <ref>7a84d536-013e-4ad0-9c5d-ea3be1e9474c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Robust grasping of bulky objects\u2014stapler positioning despite clutter <ref>bb75fd74-e346-46b9-90e4-95339133283a</ref>; wired mouse lift with cable avoidance <ref>a5247f6a-461d-4388-b35d-ed65a1e7dfc6</ref>.  \n\u2022 Reliable attribute filtering: selected non-red screwdriver correctly <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref> and isolated red items into bowl <ref>00d2b265-f7fd-409d-8b09-3112db0046d2</ref>.  \n\u2022 Quick first-move reactions give advantage when rival hesitates (dish-rack stapler, bowl-into-drawer) <ref>2265f248-723d-42e7-899e-969512516fd2</ref><ref>efa9835e-e6f0-4b4e-b29e-c10f611a6447</ref>.  \n\u2022 Reasonable recovery from partial spills: half-nut pour still redirected cup without collision <ref>7f924418-7d2a-43ba-a3d6-024065acbc9a</ref>.  \n\n4.

Instruction Following  \nStrengths:  \n\u2013 Correctly handles negation and colour filters (\u201cnon-red\u201d, \u201conly clear cup\u201d) <ref>3ebe11bd-37f5-4b6e-9abe-30e796d413a6</ref><ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>.  \n\u2013 Understands relational phrases like \u201cnext to the frog\u201d <ref>9b5f7130-d139-49f2-87fb-45dc8a47ad48</ref>.  \n\nIssues:  \n\u2013 Ignores \u201cdo absolutely nothing\u201d instruction, moving anyway <ref>25c0a175-ad1c-468e-b55e-e1029f26d94e</ref>.  \n\u2013 Struggles when text references object colour inaccurately (red stapler that is grey) causing hesitation <ref>bb75fd74-e346-46b9-90e4-95339133283a</ref>.  \n\u2013 Ambiguous spelling/typos (\u201cnon-read\u201d) were interpreted correctly once but not consistently; policy A & B both had trouble <ref>66134d40-9301-424a-80c3-fc61f98b838d</ref>.  \n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning strengths: good at selecting correct surface (orange tile) and estimating bowl opening without vision in wrist view <ref>107cb4bf-2e5a-46e1-84c1-f45467de56e6</ref>.  \nDeficits: fails to infer hidden marker location (looked only at visible purple one) <ref>e3e6aed4-d623-44f6-887d-cff04559abdf</ref>; does not plan vertical reach to shelves <ref>f80985e2-fda2-40c8-9a1c-e84e26693ceb</ref>.  Logical sequencing for multi-object \u201call items\u201d tasks also weak, stopping after first success <ref>08d3d301-7027-418b-9fe7-e11b1a23c624</ref>.  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \nGrasping: Secure large-object grasps (pineapple, stapler) successful; small thin objects (paper, cloth corner) partially successful but often bent/dropped <ref>998d501d-1b19-451d-8cd4-bcce6807ec20</ref>.  \nPlacing/stacking: Tends to release early or without alignment, leading to edge placements or toppled stacks <ref>7b034400-d225-4d3d-be8e-462f6fcb83d0</ref>.  \nPouring: Executes rotation but control of flow is coarse\u201450 % nuts missed plate <ref>7f924418-7d2a-43ba-a3d6-024065acbc9a</ref>.  \nInsertion: Limited success; portafilter and marker-in-jar both failed final drop <ref>1bd6a7c9-9ee5-4916-8483-01dd32eb93bc</ref>.  \nError recovery: Can back-off and retry (pineapple task) but sometimes freezes after miss (scissors task) <ref>48cd6a3a-f5f9-4f0f-a474-61c0bc288863</ref>.  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \nStable under lighting changes (office vs kitchen vs lab).  Handles moderate clutter\u2014success among many office items <ref>a5247f6a-461d-4388-b35d-ed65a1e7dfc6</ref>.  Sensitive to occlusion or camera views that hide the target (frog missing in wrist cam led to loss) <ref>6317140c-7d54-470e-9bfc-4b530f484f67</ref>. Height variation (shelves) and narrow receptacles notably reduce reliability.  \n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Wrong-object grasp due to colour similarity (purple vs green markers, stapler vs bowl).  \n\u2022 Early release or mis-alignment leading to object landing near, not in, target bowl/plate.  \n\u2022 Freezing halfway after first sub-goal completion (multi-item or repetitive drop tasks).  \n\u2022 Lack of vertical exploration\u2014fails to raise wrist cam to search higher shelves.  \n\u2022 Drawer and lid tasks: gripper hovers without making contact or gets stuck mid-air.  \n\u2022 Occasional self-collision with environment edges (coffee machine bump <ref>0a22cb51-9c64-43eb-948a-b795ce51edd0</ref>).  \n\nThese findings suggest pi0_fast_droid is a capable baseline for simple, single-object table-top manipulation, but further work is needed on precision alignment, sequential planning, and perception of vertically distributed scenes.",
        "summary": "- Comparative Performance: \u224852 % win-rate over 62 trials; excels on single-step, table-top pick-and-place and colour-filter tasks; outpaced by rivals on precision alignment, multi-item sequencing, drawer/lid operations and vertical-reach scenarios; many \u201cwins\u201d are partial successes gained by acting while opponents stall.  \n\n- Strengths: Generates smooth, decisive trajectories; re-grasps after misses; reliable grasping of bulky objects and avoidance of cables/clutter; accurate colour-based object selection and simple relational language; quick first moves often secure advantage; occasional recovery after minor spills.  \n\n- Weaknesses: Confuses similarly coloured objects; imprecise releases lead to edge drops or toppled stacks; frequent freezing after first sub-goal; poor vertical exploration and inconsistent drawer/lid manipulation; tendency to pick distractors in clutter.  \n\n- Instruction Following: Correctly handles negation, colour filters, and simple spatial relations; ignores \u201cdo nothing\u201d commands and hesitates when colour labels clash with perception; inconsistent with typos or ambiguous wording.  \n\n- Reasoning: Adequate surface/containment selection, but limited hidden-object inference, vertical planning, and multi-step sequencing; stops after first item in \u201cplace all\u201d tasks and fails to reason about shelf height.  \n\n- Manipulation Skills: Strong, stable grasps on large objects; weaker with thin or small items; placement and stacking accuracy low, pouring coarse, insertions unreliable; can back-off and retry but may stall after an error.  \n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Tolerant to lighting changes and moderate clutter; performance degrades with occlusions, narrow receptacles, or elevated targets; shelf and high-reach tasks particularly brittle.  \n\n- Common Failure Modes: Wrong-object grasps due to colour similarity, early release/misalignment near target, mid-task freezing, lack of vertical search, stalled drawer/lid interactions, occasional self-collisions.",

Although multiple objects are present, the spoon and dish rack are clearly visible and not obstructed. The spoon is placed flat on the table, easily accessible, and the dish rack is positioned clearly at one side of the table. The additional objects could serve as distractors, but they are spaced apart enough to minimize interference with the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The spoon is clearly visible, lying flat on the table, and the dish rack is open and easily accessible. The robot should be able to grasp the spoon without difficulty, as there are no immediate obstacles or challenging orientations. The presence of distractors slightly increases complexity, but overall, the task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_fast_droid was Policy B\nResult: pi0_fast_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: They both pick up the wrong object",

The third-person views clearly show the overall environment, the position of the stapler, and the sheet of paper. The top-down view provides a close-up and clear perspective of the stapler and paper, making it easy to identify their relative positions and orientations. Overall, the camera angles are sufficient and provide clear visibility of the objects and environment necessary for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is bright and evenly distributed, providing good visibility of the objects and workspace. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the red stapler on the sheet of paper\" is clear and straightforward. However, there is a discrepancy in the description, as the stapler visible in the images appears gray and black rather than red. This color mismatch introduces ambiguity and could potentially confuse the robot or evaluator.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a countertop workspace with several objects present. The primary objects relevant to the task are the stapler and the sheet of paper, both clearly visible and accessible. However, there are multiple distractor objects, including a tape roll, orange container, cables, and other miscellaneous items, which could potentially interfere with the robot's manipulation. The stapler is placed close to the paper, oriented in a way that should be easy to grasp and move. The paper is flat and unobstructed, providing a clear target area for placing the stapler.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The clear visibility, good lighting, and straightforward nature of the task (placing one object onto another) simplify the manipulation. However, the presence of distractor objects and the color discrepancy in the task description (red stapler vs. gray stapler) could introduce confusion or errors. The robot will need to accurately identify and grasp the correct object despite the cluttered environment and color ambiguity.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_fast_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_fast_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Policy A at least made an attempt to reach for the red stapler (although it reached both stapler that are placed on the table); policy B in the other hand, picked up the nail puller and thus received a score of 0.",

The third-person views clearly show the overall environment, the robot arm, and the objects involved, including the tape and the block of paper. The top-down view from the wrist camera clearly shows the block of paper, but the tape is only partially visible, making it slightly challenging to precisely determine the tape's position from this angle alone.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the tape on the block of paper\" is clear and understandable. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The instruction is straightforward and unambiguous.\n\nScene: The scene is set up on a countertop with several objects present. The primary objects relevant to the task, the tape and the block of paper, are clearly visible and accessible. However, there are multiple distractors and unnecessary objects, such as a stapler, colored blocks, a container, and other miscellaneous items, which could potentially interfere with the robot's manipulation or cause confusion. The block of paper is placed at an angle, but it is still easily accessible. The tape is placed flat on the countertop, clearly visible and reachable.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty.

However, perception and high-level decision making are fragile: the system frequently hesitates for long stretches, mis-identifies objects of similar color / shape, or stops after completing only part of a multi-step instruction.  In cluttered scenes it tends to \u201cplay it safe\u201d rather than explore aggressively, which keeps it from large collisions but also lowers task completion rate.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \nAcross the 61 recorded head-to-head episodes pi0_droid won 21, lost 25 and tied 15, for an overall win-rate of \u224834 %.  \n\u2022 It wins mostly when the competing policy freezes or collides, and on simple \u201cpick-and-drop\u201d or \u201cput X in/onto Y\u201d tasks such as putting a ball in a bin <ref>7d574986-89eb-4b33-a624-a17903b1baf0</ref> or moving a doll into a bag <ref>16e5bbda-57c1-4e58-a24a-b39ee8142d41</ref>.  \n\u2022 It consistently under-performs on fine-grained or sequential tasks that require (1) respecting order (\u201ctouch book then bear\u201d <ref>4cdf7321-f9ad-4a9d-8529-cf7cc08b6f20</ref>), (2) orientation control (tilting banana into a bottle <ref>8c55a6ce-fee6-42fe-bfd2-1c63f6b3fa8d</ref>), or (3) moving several items (\u201cplace all items on orange tile\u201d <ref>107cb4bf-2e5a-46e1-84c1-f45467de56e6</ref>).  \n\nKey episode-level insights  \n\u2022 Simple single-object pick-and-place: pi0_droid outperformed the rival in 10/14 such trials, e.g. envelope \u2192 trash bin <ref>9da2a843-0ae6-482c-9f68-2cfc74c09496</ref>, cup \u2192 dustbin <ref>e0f7ee84-36d9-417c-be68-90fac2ea5a43</ref>.  \n\u2022 Container insertion needing orientation was a weakness: lost on banana\u2192bottle <ref>8c55a6ce</ref>, marker\u2192jar <ref>c5c9e0b7-3b47-4459-b179-268e857362a0</ref>, ball\u2192cup <ref>5da3d203-1c40-468d-82bf-0d951565d99c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Multi-object ordering: failed on \u201ctouch two books\u201d <ref>6e4a029a-24a3-4d7e-beca-88d8d439ed26</ref> and \u201cmove cloth then bowl\u201d <ref>2a6b9acf-1e66-4312-9d23-bfa0824337fe</ref>; won when rival never moved (red cube \u2192 bowl, marker \u2192 bowl) <ref>6d7586e4-3bab-4ff3-a8ad-ecdb25e83300</ref>.  \n\u2022 Motion speed: Several judges noted long idle periods before any movement, leading to losses even when the eventual motion was correct (green cube on bowl <ref>ac0ea231-970e-4385-8c79-721106e792aa</ref>).  \n\u2022 Vision ambiguity: Choosing wrong object of same class caused losses on purple vs red marker <ref>fcd79a4d-50c9-4342-aa19-93881eb68264</ref>, tape vs bowl <ref>c850017f-bd6d-4cc5-9ab0-2a7a7af47949</ref>.  \n\u2022 Drawer / door interaction: mixed \u2014 wins on \u201cput marker in drawer\u201d <ref>4d49c628-82eb-4457-93a2-34f1af710fa6</ref>, but ties or losses on opening/closing other drawers <ref>5cf6a9aa-0c2a-4417-95ea-7be327ed62d6</ref> <ref>dac2ddf1-4ae3-443e-ab78-59dfabe43f63</ref>.  \n\u2022 Safety: judges repeatedly commented that pi0_droid avoided harsh collisions (metal cup task <ref>ef97c98d-18fa-4bd4-a35b-6cda1ba64e8c</ref>), giving it an edge whenever the rival slammed into furniture.  \n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Reliable basic grasp-and-place on isolated objects (marker\u2192bowl <ref>24f3883a-d9a9-4351-ba8a-df85ab678168</ref>, ball\u2192bin <ref>7d574986-89eb-4b33-a624-a17903b1baf0</ref>).  \n\u2022 Maintains smooth trajectories with few jerky reversals; beneficial in tight scenes such as stacking bowls <ref>70292884-f521-4567-8986-6640566547fb</ref>.  \n\u2022 Shows collision avoidance and \u201ccautious probing\u201d near appliances (espresso machine <ref>0a22cb51-9c64-43eb-948a-b795ce51edd0</ref>; coffee machine <ref>ef97c98d-18fa-4bd4-a35b-6cda1ba64e8c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Can recover from minor grasp slips, e.g. re-gripping envelope after drop <ref>9da2a843-0ae6-482c-9f68-2cfc74c09496</ref>.  \n\u2022 Performs well when visual target is texture-rich and isolated (green marker on blue cloth <ref>5990f8b2-ce9c-4dce-93ff-9dc89a99175c</ref>).  \n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Slow deliberation / long idle phases leading to time-outs (<ref>ac0ea231-970e-4385-8c79-721106e792aa</ref>, <ref>d40e2c68-068e-4f60-8546-3432f3190fcb</ref>).  \n\u2022 Frequent object confusion when multiple similar items exist (purple vs red marker <ref>fcd79a4d-50c9-4342-aa19-93881eb68264</ref>; multiple cups <ref>81f7c34b-1cc9-466c-802c-304934734227</ref>).  \n\u2022 Poor orientation reasoning\u2014fails to tilt or angle objects into narrow receptacles (banana\u2192bottle <ref>8c55a6ce-fee6-42fe-bfd2-1c63f6b3fa8d</ref>, screwdriver\u2192mug <ref>d4297036-4874-47c2-9ee6-8923cf2c388d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Limited multi-step memory: often completes first sub-goal only (touch book but not bear <ref>4cdf7321-f9ad-4a9d-8529-cf7cc08b6f20</ref>).  \n\u2022 Hesitates or gives up when the target is partially occluded (straw not visible <ref>8a11cfb9-63e8-4922-ba65-5253aa9303e0</ref>).  \n\u2022 Tendency to pick distractor with similar affordance (tape vs towel <ref>c850017f-bd6d-4cc5-9ab0-2a7a7af47949</ref>, eraser vs bread <ref>40dc1e54-9b74-4774-8019-9ca4395f1ecb</ref>).  \n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Handles straightforward imperative commands well (\u201cput X in Y\u201d, \u201cpick up Z\u201d).  \n\u2022 Struggles with sequential or negated instructions: touching items in order failed <ref>4cdf7321</ref>; \u201cdo absolutely nothing\u201d ignored <ref>25c0a175-ad1c-468e-b55e-e1029f26d94e</ref>.  \n\u2022 Case sensitivity and polite prefixes have no observable impact (compare \u201cplease touch\u2026\u201d <ref>6e4a029a-24a3-4d7e-beca-88d8d439ed26</ref> vs SHOUTING \u201cPICK UP THE STRAW\u201d <ref>8a11cfb9</ref>).  \n\u2022 Ambiguous or incomplete language (\u201cpick up the ___ and put it on one of the cards\u201d) causes passivity; both policies tied <ref>5cea1a60-a992-420c-b919-bc2183b2d2f6</ref>.  \n\u2022 Can ignore minor typos (\u201ctowl\u201d for towel) and still succeed <ref>8807b50e-01b1-4f49-8931-395b48e2224d</ref>.  \n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning  \n\u2713 Shows awareness of large free space and avoids obstacles when moving bowls or bins (<ref>7d574986</ref>, <ref>e0f7ee84</ref>).  \n\u2717 Fails to account for depth/orientation constraints\u2014does not rotate banana to fit bottle <ref>8c55a6ce</ref> or align cube before stacking <ref>7b034400-d225-4d3d-be8e-462f6fcb83d0</ref>.  \n\nText reasoning  \n\u2713 Correctly interprets location prepositions like \u201con\u201d vs \u201cin\u201d (marker on white paper \u2192 drawer task <ref>4d49c628</ref>).  \n\u2717 Ignores ordering words (\u201cthen\u201d, \u201cafter\u201d) and exclusivity clauses (\u201cnothing else\u201d) leading to errors <ref>d80e7555-39aa-44e3-8858-333a5034b07b</ref>.  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \nGrasping: Stable grasps on cylinders, cubes, plush toys; rarely drops once fully closed (<ref>4d49c628</ref>, <ref>16e5bbda</ref>).  \nPlacing: Decent precision for large receptacles (bin, bowl) but limited fine placement; cube sometimes held above target and timed-out <ref>ac0ea231</ref>.  \nStacking: Able to align bowls better than rival but blocks still topple <ref>70292884</ref>.  \nInsertion: Weak for narrow openings (bottle, mug, jar).  \nDrawer operations: Can pull or push when handle is in clear view (top drawer <ref>60dc912d</ref>), but sometimes stops short of closing <ref>dac2ddf1-4ae3-443e-ab78-59dfabe43f63</ref>.  \nRecovery: Occasionally re-grips after drop (envelope) but often freezes once an error occurs (sponge task <ref>6d0b94cd</ref>).  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \n\u2022 Lighting: Performs similarly under bright studio and dim household light (bear on books <ref>2e1d844d-9167-4219-92e8-418b3f464b84</ref>).  \n\u2022 Clutter: Light to moderate clutter acceptable; heavy clutter causes confusion (office desk tasks <ref>998d501d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Occlusion: Fails when target partially hidden or outside wrist-cam FOV (straw <ref>8a11cfb9</ref>, drawer handles behind bowl <ref>5cf6a9aa</ref>).  \n\u2022 Viewpoint: Reliance on third-person cameras is evident; tasks where target is only visible wrist-down see more idle time.  \n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Long initial freeze / no exploration (<ref>5cf6a9aa-0c2a-4417-95ea-7be327ed62d6</ref>).  \n\u2022 Selecting a distractor of same class/color (<ref>fcd79a4d</ref>, <ref>c850017f</ref>).  \n\u2022 Completing only first step of multi-part command (<ref>998d501d</ref>, <ref>4cdf7321</ref>).  \n\u2022 Hovering over goal without releasing (cube above bowl <ref>ac0ea231</ref>).  \n\u2022 Mis-oriented insertions causing blockage (banana, screwdriver).  \n\u2022 Minor collisions with large appliances when depth estimation is off (coffee machine <ref>ef97c98d</ref>).  \n\nOverall, pi0_droid demonstrates competent low-level control but needs improved perception, sequencing and object-specific affordance reasoning to consistently beat peer policies.",
        "summary": "- Comparative Performance: \u224834 % win rate (21 W / 25 L / 15 T); wins mostly on straightforward single-object pick-and-place when rival freezes; loses on tasks needing order, orientation or multiple items; idle pauses and object mis-ID hurt score; cautious motion avoids crashes and yields some default wins.  \n\n- Strengths: Smooth, collision-aware arm paths; reliable grasps and placements on isolated, texture-rich targets; effective collision avoidance near furniture; can re-grip after minor slips; strong on simple bin/bowl transfers.  \n\n- Weaknesses: Slow deliberation causing time-outs; confuses visually similar objects; poor orientation reasoning for insertions; limited multi-step memory; hesitates with occlusions; prone to grabbing affordance-similar distractors.  \n\n- Instruction Following: Executes direct imperatives well; often ignores ordering, sequential or negated clauses; polite prefixes/case irrelevant; ambiguous commands cause passivity; tolerates minor typos.  \n\n- Reasoning: Understands basic spatial prepositions and free-space constraints; neglects depth/orientation requirements; disregards \u201cthen/after\u201d and exclusivity terms, leading to partial task completion.  \n\n- Manipulation Skills: Stable grasps on common shapes, reasonable placement into large receptacles, moderate bowl stacking, weak insertion into narrow mouths, drawer handling works when handle visible, limited recovery after major errors.  \n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Lighting changes tolerated; light\u2013moderate clutter acceptable but heavy clutter confuses; fails with partial occlusion or wrist-only view; strong dependence on third-person cameras.  \n\n- Common Failure Modes: Long initial freeze, selecting wrong same-class object, completing only first sub-goal, hovering without release, jammed insertions from wrong orientation, minor bumps when depth estimate off.",

            "Session ID: d80e7555-39aa-44e3-8858-333a5034b07b\nTask: just touch the red box and nothing else\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a top-down view from the robot's wrist camera and a third-person view from the side. The top-down view clearly shows the robot's gripper and the immediate area in front of it, but the red box mentioned in the task description is not clearly visible or identifiable from this angle. The third-person view provides a broader perspective of the environment, but similarly, the red box is not clearly visible or identifiable, making it difficult to determine its exact location or orientation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is sufficient and evenly distributed, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task. The objects and surfaces are clearly visible.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"just touch the red box and nothing else\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the robot's objective, leaving no ambiguity regarding the intended action. However, the red box itself is not clearly visible in the provided images, introducing uncertainty about the exact target object.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black perforated table surface with several objects placed on or near it, including a stuffed animal, cardboard boxes, a cloth, and some miscellaneous items. These objects could potentially serve as distractors or obstacles. The red box mentioned in the task description is not clearly visible or identifiable in either image, making it difficult to determine its exact position or orientation. The presence of multiple objects and clutter could complicate the robot's task of precisely touching only the red box.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately difficult due to the unclear visibility and identification of the red box in the provided images. The presence of multiple distractor objects and clutter on the table further increases the complexity, as the robot must carefully avoid touching anything other than the intended target. The task requires precise perception and careful motion planning to ensure successful completion without unintended interactions.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: policy A tries to touch the red box but takes a long time to do anything and ends up failing by touching the green frog first. Policy B goes sstraight for the red box and knocks it over but fails in that it touches other items. Policy B was much more decisive and quicker while Policy A was testing my patience.",

The third-person view clearly shows the brown bear placed on top of a box, providing a good perspective of the environment and the objects involved. However, the top-down view from the wrist camera does not clearly show the bear itself, making it difficult to precisely identify the target object from this angle alone.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"knock the brown bear off the box\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the action required and the target object, leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene setup is relatively simple and uncluttered. The brown bear is clearly placed on top of a cardboard box, making it easily identifiable and accessible. There are a few other objects present, such as additional boxes and small items, but they are positioned away from the main task area and do not appear to interfere significantly with the task execution.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be relatively easy. The bear is clearly visible and placed in an accessible position on top of the box. The robot only needs to perform a simple pushing or knocking motion, which does not require precise or dexterous manipulation. The lack of clutter and clear visibility further simplify the task.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy B\nResult: pi0_droid lost\nEvaluation notes: both policies immediately knocked the brown bear but policy A just focused on the brown bear while policy B knocked the entire box.

Both angles clearly show the workspace, the objects placed on the table, and the robot's gripper. The top-down view provides a clear perspective of the immediate area in front of the robot, while the side view gives additional context about object placement and environment.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, clearly illuminating the workspace and objects. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder observation or task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"do absolutely nothing. do not move\" is clear and unambiguous. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The instruction explicitly states that the robot should remain stationary and perform no actions.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black perforated table surface with a cardboard box and some colored objects stacked on top of it. There is also a small object placed separately on the table. The objects are clearly visible, neatly arranged, and do not appear cluttered or distracting. The robot's gripper is visible in the top-down view, positioned above the objects. The setup is simple and does not contain unnecessary clutter or distractors that would interfere with the robot's ability to follow the given instruction.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears very easy. Given the explicit instruction to remain stationary and perform no actions, the robot does not need to interact with or manipulate any objects. The clear and simple scene setup, combined with the straightforward instruction, makes this task trivial to execute.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: both policies completely failed to adhere to my instructions.",

Both views clearly show the objects involved in the task, providing sufficient visibility of the apple and book objects. The top-down view is particularly helpful for precise positioning, clearly showing the spatial arrangement of the objects.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task. The objects and their colors are clearly distinguishable.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"touch the book with the apple\" is clear and understandable. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The instruction is straightforward and unambiguous.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black perforated table surface with three square-shaped objects placed in a row, each with a clear image on top. One of these objects clearly depicts an apple, and another appears to depict a book. There are additional objects in the background (a green toy and a brown plush toy), but they are placed far enough away from the main objects and do not seem to interfere with the task. The objects relevant to the task are clearly visible, well-oriented, and not obstructed or hidden.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The objects involved (apple and book) are clearly identifiable, well-separated, and easily accessible.

The third-person views clearly show the overall environment and the compartments of the wooden box, but the top-down view provides the clearest perspective of the objects' positions and orientations, making it suitable for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the two pink objects next to each other\" is clear and understandable. It is written in lowercase letters without spelling or grammatical mistakes. However, there is slight ambiguity regarding the exact final placement of the objects, as \"next to each other\" could imply different orientations or distances.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a wooden box divided into compartments, containing several objects. The objects include a variety of colorful items, such as fruits and vegetables, and a bowl. The two pink objects mentioned in the task description are clearly visible in the top-down view, placed separately in one compartment. The other compartments contain distractor objects, but they are separated by dividers, reducing the likelihood of interference. The scene is relatively organized, with minimal clutter.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The two pink objects are clearly visible and accessible, and the compartmentalized setup reduces interference from distractors. However, the robot must precisely grasp and reposition one of the pink objects next to the other, requiring accurate manipulation and spatial reasoning. The presence of other objects in the same compartment may slightly increase the complexity of the task.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: pi0_droid was Policy A\nResult: pi0_droid won\nEvaluation notes: A tried to reach one of the pink objects, while B stucked and couldn't move.",

        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npaligemma_binning_droid exhibits extremely conservative behaviour: it frequently stays at or near the home position and only rarely attempts grasps or motions.  When it does move, trajectories are slow and collision-averse, but grasps are weak and the action often terminates before the goal is satisfied.  The policy shows occasional flashes of visual grounding (e.g., correctly contacting two distinct books) yet generally fails to complete basic pick\u2013place, wiping, stacking or insertion skills.  Overall, safety and passivity dominate over task completion.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\nOverall head-to-head record across 49 episodes  \nWins : 3\u2003Ties : 5\u2003Losses : 41  \n(win rate \u2248 6 %, tie 10 %, loss 84 %)\n\n\u2022 Best relative results occurred when the opposing policy made a larger error than simply \u201cdoing nothing\u201d.  For example, on \u201ctouch two different books\u201d the competitor touched only one book while paligemma_binning_droid simultaneously touched two and won <ref>6e4a029a-24a3-4d7e-beca-88d8d439ed26</ref>.  \n\u2022 On \u201cPut the water bottle on the table\u201d the robot at least approached the bottle whereas Policy A hovered randomly, giving paligemma_binning_droid the win despite not finishing the task <ref>e578f30a-1e7f-4bad-a269-4e293955b622</ref>.  \n\u2022 In \u201cplace portafilter handle into coffee-grinder slot\u201d the evaluator preferred paligemma_binning_droid\u2019s total refusal to act over the competitor\u2019s unsafe exploratory motion, scoring a win by \u201csafe rejection\u201d <ref>08bf285a-2a05-4deb-bfba-37080457e9e6</ref>.  \n\nDetailed comparative insights  \n\u2013 Competitors out-performed the policy on 90 % of simple pick-and-place tasks (e.g., red cube to green bowl <ref>189d9705-ca72-46e3-870d-03ae7ededb34</ref>, pineapple to bowl <ref>e8dc673d-c7b1-415a-94e3-2b238588caed</ref>, carrot to dish <ref>7d90355d-5fa1-4eab-8839-02a99099c967</ref>).  \n\u2013 Relational placement commands (\u201cleft of\u201d, \u201cnext to\u201d, \u201cinto plate\u201d) were almost always lost because the policy never attempted a corrective motion, while rivals at least tried (carrot/mug <ref>dd4c3c4f-27d7-4c61-af76-69bf6608ad0d</ref>, cup/purple plate <ref>b0ca9723-1ac9-4c4f-932b-e782341306e7</ref>).  \n\u2013 Multi-step instructions showed an even larger gap: in \u201cmove cube out, marker in\u201d the opponent began the sequence whereas paligemma_binning_droid stayed idle <ref>dc62fbd2-1f0f-46d0-9e07-967d702b85f7</ref>.  \n\u2013 Where identification required category reasoning (\u201cfind the fruit\u201d, \u201cpick up the vegetable\u201d), the competitor at least grasped a plausible object while our policy froze, producing losses <ref>9c7734f2-1eb4-408e-bc3e-bb07a4f3c757</ref><ref>75f2f013-65dc-4827-aab8-dc21caaa5f5a</ref>.  \n\u2013 Ties typically occurred because both systems failed (e.g., \u201ctouch the book\u201d where neither could locate a book <ref>7516f9ba-b25f-4135-8faa-27055c6d8b8c</ref>) or because both partially moved but never accomplished the goal (\u201cstapler on towel\u201d <ref>136c1c3e-8635-4974-a040-d30b109e925d</ref>).  \n\u2013 The opponent displayed better initiative on almost every wiping, drawer, door, stacking or cleaning task, leading to decisive losses (dust off paper <ref>0f4d8f93-75d6-4596-98ee-00f806f25888</ref>, close drawer <ref>41479fcb-a0d9-4672-b7ff-63da05e361f7</ref>, stack cups <ref>bbedead2-f35c-4ec2-91ee-6104cfa7743f</ref>).  \n\nKey insights (comparative)  \n\u2022 paligemma_binning_droid rarely initiates motion, giving rivals an automatic advantage.  \n\u2022 When it does move, it is slower; rivals often complete half the task before paligemma_binning_droid reaches the first object.  \n\u2022 Its few wins arise from opponent mistakes rather than strong performance.  \n\u2022 Competitors consistently grasp the correct object first; paligemma_binning_droid either idles or contacts the wrong item (<ref>b2607c46-4bba-412a-a0fc-52b4d7e6089e</ref>, <ref>607e32ff-859b-4e09-a47f-5630b85ed220</ref>).  \n\u2022 The policy\u2019s conservative nature can be viewed as safer (avoiding collisions in coffee-machine scene <ref>ef97c98d-18fa-4bd4-a35b-6cda1ba64e8c</ref>), but evaluators still scored safety lower than partial task progress in most episodes.  \n\u2022 Presence of distractor objects hurts both policies, but competitors cope better; our policy often fails even in uncluttered scenes (e.g., empty table, spoon task <ref>4430675d-f714-481d-93da-0a170a469c04</ref>).  \n\u2022 Visual ambiguity leads to total inactivity, whereas competitors at least guess (fruit, vegetable, book).  \n\u2022 Multi-step and relational language disparities magnify the gap in favour of competitors.  \n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Collision-averse and generally safe: tends to halt rather than force a bad grasp, preventing damage in cluttered coffee-machine settings <ref>ef97c98d-18fa-4bd4-a35b-6cda1ba64e8c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Can make accurate contact when the scene is extremely simple and planar, as shown by simultaneously touching two separate books <ref>6e4a029a-24a3-4d7e-beca-88d8d439ed26</ref>.  \n\u2022 Occasionally identifies the target object correctly and approaches it (water bottle <ref>e578f30a-1e7f-4bad-a269-4e293955b622</ref>).  \n\u2022 Refuses out-of-distribution or ambiguous instructions rather than executing unsafe actions (portafilter handle case) <ref>08bf285a-2a05-4deb-bfba-37080457e9e6</ref>.  \n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Very high inactivity rate\u2014robot frequently remains at the reset pose for the entire episode (<ref>189d9705-ca72-46e3-870d-03ae7ededb34</ref>, <ref>e8dc673d-c7b1-415a-94e3-2b238588caed</ref>, <ref>24f3883a-d9a9-4351-ba8a-df85ab678168</ref>).  \n\u2022 Poor grasp execution; even when at the object, fails to close gripper or lifts and drops (cup into bowl <ref>b0ca9723-1ac9-4c4f-932b-e782341306e7</ref>).  \n\u2022 Misidentifies colour or relational attributes: grabbed red box instead of non-red object <ref>b6b4e19d-5b3d-4d20-8636-e0ce160eefae</ref>.  \n\u2022 Cannot execute multi-step plans (cube out / marker in bowl) <ref>dc62fbd2-1f0f-46d0-9e07-967d702b85f7</ref>.  \n\u2022 Struggles with simple drawer, door, wiping or stacking mechanics; rivals routinely beat it (<ref>56a06dda-819f-4418-8f64-28ef0571dc23</ref>, <ref>41479fcb-a0d9-4672-b7ff-63da05e361f7</ref>).  \n\u2022 Susceptible to complete freezes after a few seconds of motion (<ref>dc3eaeec-ce1d-41b8-8ec3-5eaf03c4386c</ref>).  \n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Handles count modifiers reasonably (touched \u201ctwo different books\u201d) <ref>6e4a029a-24a3-4d7e-beca-88d8d439ed26</ref>.  \n\u2022 Fails with negation/attribute filters (\u201cobject that is not RED\u201d)\u2014went for red item <ref>b6b4e19d-5b3d-4d20-8636-e0ce160eefae</ref>.  \n\u2022 Relational spatial phrases (\u201cto the left of\u201d, \u201cnext to\u201d, \u201cinto purple plate\u201d) are usually ignored, producing no motion <ref>dd4c3c4f-27d7-4c61-af76-69bf6608ad0d</ref><ref>9b5f7130-d139-49f2-87fb-45dc8a47ad48</ref>.  \n\u2022 Multi-clause requests overwhelm the parser (cube / marker swap) <ref>dc62fbd2-1f0f-46d0-9e07-967d702b85f7</ref>.  \n\u2022 Minor typos in instructions (\u201cpalce\u201d) did not change outcome\u2014the policy still froze, while rival executed <ref>4f26d14f-b4a7-437d-aba5-b5d9a735393a</ref>.  \n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning: struggles to infer hidden or partially occluded targets; inactivity in \u201cfind the fruit\u201d where fruit not visible <ref>9c7734f2-1eb4-408e-bc3e-bb07a4f3c757</ref>.  \nSemantic reasoning: does not reconcile category errors (\u201cpick up the vegetable\u201d when only fruit present) and therefore halts <ref>75f2f013-65dc-4827-aab8-dc21caaa5f5a</ref>.  \nPositive example: understood that \u201cbook\u201d referred to same class across two objects and touched both <ref>6e4a029a-24a3-4d7e-beca-88d8d439ed26</ref>.  \nOverall, reasoning is brittle and often defaults to non-action rather than making a plausible guess, whereas competitors attempt.  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasping: few successful grasps; even in rare successes (water-bottle approach) the object was not lifted <ref>e578f30a-1e7f-4bad-a269-4e293955b622</ref>.  \n\u2022 Placing / stacking: no completed stack or placement task; lost in every bowl/plate/drawer episode.  \n\u2022 Insertion: never aligned objects into containers; relative success only when \u201ctouch\u201d required minimal force.  \n\u2022 Wiping, pouring, opening/closing mechanisms: zero completions; rivals at least attempted wiping (<ref>0f4d8f93-75d6-4596-98ee-00f806f25888</ref>) and drawer closing (<ref>41479fcb-a0d9-4672-b7ff-63da05e361f7</ref>).  \n\u2022 Recovery: once halted, the controller seldom re-plans; freezes persist until timeout.  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \nLighting changes (dim scene in \u201cgather all items\u201d) led to total inactivity <ref>03dd60d7-a3c7-4cdc-9ad3-dbf7e293b574</ref>.  \nClutter: even in uncluttered tabletop scenes the policy under-performed, indicating limited relevance of clutter to failure.  \nCamera occlusion: wrist-camera blockage often precedes freeze (stack bowls <ref>70292884-f521-4567-8986-6640566547fb</ref>).  \nOverall robustness is low; behaviour (mostly idling) is unchanged across variations, which incidentally masks some environmental sensitivities.  \n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Full episode freeze at home pose (<ref>b69cc947-4a6a-4ae0-88d1-cad25004e371</ref>, many others).  \n\u2022 Half-motion then stall\u2014single downward move, then no further action (<ref>e8dc673d-c7b1-415a-94e3-2b238588caed</ref>).  \n\u2022 Wrong-object grasp due to colour/position confusion (<ref>b0ca9723-1ac9-4c4f-932b-e782341306e7</ref>, <ref>b6b4e19d-5b3d-4d20-8636-e0ce160eefae</ref>).  \n\u2022 Collision with large structure (coffee machine) after straight unsafe trajectory <ref>ef97c98d-18fa-4bd4-a35b-6cda1ba64e8c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Incomplete grasps\u2014object pinched but dropped immediately (mug pour <ref>ba7b5a70-7556-4697-b8a3-453fb93656d2</ref>).  \n\u2022 Failure to execute secondary steps in multi-stage tasks (cube / marker swap, drawer close).  \n\u2022 Mis-execution of relational placement, e.g., placing carrot in front rather than left <ref>dd4c3c4f-27d7-4c61-af76-69bf6608ad0d</ref>.",
        "summary": "- Comparative Performance: ~6 % wins vs 84 % losses; near-static behaviour lets rivals outperform on almost all pick-place, relational and multi-step tasks; rare victories stem from opponent errors, not policy skill; slow, cautious motions seen as less valuable than partial task progress.\n\n- Strengths: strongly collision-averse, prefers inaction to risky moves; occasionally grounds simple visuals (e.g., touches two books); safely rejects unclear or OOD instructions, offering limited safety benefit.\n\n- Weaknesses: extremely high inactivity, frequent full-episode idling; weak or dropped grasps, mis-identifies colours/attributes; cannot execute multi-step, drawer, wiping, stacking or insertion tasks; prone to freezing after initial motion.\n\n- Instruction Following: handles simple count words; fails on negation, spatial relations and multi-clause commands; minor typos do not alter outcome; language understanding generally poor, leading to no action.\n\n- Reasoning: brittle scene and semantic reasoning; stalls when objects occluded or category ambiguous; seldom guesses, defaults to inaction; only occasional success on straightforward class reasoning (books).\n\n- Manipulation Skills: very few successful grasps and no completed lifts; zero success in placing, stacking, insertion, wiping, or mechanism operation; lacks recovery once halted, showing weak low-level control.\n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: performance remains uniformly poor across lighting, clutter and occlusion; dim scenes or blocked camera easily cause total freeze; overall robustness low despite consistent (idle) behaviour.\n\n- Common Failure Modes: entire episode idle at home, mid-motion stall, wrong-object grasp, weak grasp then drop, occasional collision with large fixtures, abandonment of later steps in multi-stage tasks, incorrect relational placement.",

Both views clearly show the objects on the table, providing sufficient visibility of the books and their arrangement. The top-down view is particularly helpful for precise manipulation, clearly showing the relative positions and orientations of the books.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task. The objects and their colors are clearly distinguishable.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"please touch two different books\" is clear and straightforward. There are no spelling or grammatical mistakes, and the instruction is concise and easy to understand. The lowercase formatting is consistent and does not affect clarity.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black perforated table surface with three clearly visible books placed neatly in a row. Each book has a distinct cover, making them easy to differentiate. There are a few distractor objects (a green toy and a brown plush toy) placed at the far end of the table, but they are sufficiently distant from the books and unlikely to interfere with the task. The books are well-separated, clearly visible, and easily accessible for manipulation.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The books are clearly visible, well-separated, and easily distinguishable from each other. The robot has ample space to maneuver, and the distractor objects are placed far enough away to avoid interference. The task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, as it only involves touching two different books, making it straightforward to execute.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_binning_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_binning_droid won\nEvaluation notes: policy B was slower to act but in the end touched two books at the same time while policy A just touched one of them.",

The top-down view from the wrist camera is less clear, as it mostly shows the robot's gripper and only partially captures the box, making it difficult to clearly identify the contents inside.\n\nLighting: The lighting is sufficient overall, with no significant shadows or glares affecting visibility. The objects and environment are clearly visible, and the lighting does not appear to hinder the robot's ability to perform the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"find the fruit\" is clear and concise, with no spelling or grammatical errors. However, it does not specify the type of fruit or how the robot should indicate that it has found the fruit, leaving some ambiguity in the exact expectations of the task.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a simple setup with a cardboard box placed centrally on a table. Inside the box, there appear to be some objects, but their visibility is limited from the provided angles. There is minimal clutter or distractors in the environment, making the scene relatively straightforward. However, the fruit itself is not clearly visible or identifiable from the provided images, potentially complicating the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately difficult. While the environment is simple and uncluttered, the fruit is not clearly visible or identifiable from the provided camera angles, especially from the wrist camera view.

The third-person views clearly show the overall environment, the compartments, and the placement of the bowl. The top-down view provides a clear and detailed perspective of the objects, their positions, and their orientations, making it suitable for precise manipulation tasks.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and the environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up the different object among the three and palce it in the bowl\" contains a spelling mistake (\"palce\" instead of \"place\"). Apart from this minor error, the instruction is clear and understandable. The robot is expected to identify the object that is different from the other two and place it into the bowl.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a wooden compartmentalized box placed on a white table. One compartment contains three objects: two spherical objects (one purple and one orange) and one blue circular object, clearly identifiable as the different one. Another compartment contains a bowl, which is the target location for placing the object. The third compartment contains additional objects (fruit-shaped items), but these are separated by dividers and do not directly interfere with the task. The objects are clearly visible, well-separated, and easily accessible, with no unnecessary clutter or distractors.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The different object (the blue circular object) is clearly distinguishable from the other two spherical objects. The objects are well-separated, clearly visible, and easily accessible. The bowl is placed in a separate compartment, clearly visible, and easy to reach.

Both views clearly show the red cube and green bowl, providing sufficient visual information for the robot to execute the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting is adequate, with no significant shadows or glares that would hinder visibility or task execution. The objects and environment are clearly visible, and the lighting conditions appear consistent across both images.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up red cube and put in green bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There are no spelling mistakes or ambiguities, and the instructions are straightforward and easy to understand.\n\nScene: The scene setup is simple and uncluttered, consisting of a red cube and a green bowl placed on a perforated black surface. There are no distractors or unnecessary objects that could interfere with the task. Both objects are clearly visible, easily identifiable, and placed in positions that are accessible for manipulation.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The simplicity of the scene, clear visibility, straightforward instructions, and accessible placement of the cube and bowl suggest that the robot should be able to complete the task without significant difficulty.

The third-person views offer a good overview of the robot's position relative to the workspace, while the top-down view clearly shows the paper pieces and their arrangement on the surface. Overall, the camera angles provide sufficient visibility of the objects and environment necessary for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task. The workspace and objects are clearly visible, making it easy to distinguish the paper pieces from the background.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"dust off the paper pieces\" is understandable but slightly ambiguous. The phrase \"dust off\" could imply either brushing the paper pieces away or picking them up and removing them from the surface. Clarifying the intended action explicitly would help avoid confusion. There are no spelling or grammar mistakes, and the description is in lowercase letters, which does not affect clarity.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a countertop workspace with several scattered paper pieces clearly visible. However, the workspace also contains multiple unrelated objects, such as markers, a stapler, notebooks, and colored blocks, which could potentially act as distractors or obstacles. The paper pieces are randomly oriented but clearly visible and not hidden or obstructed, making them relatively easy to identify and manipulate.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately easy. The paper pieces are clearly visible, and the robot has sufficient space to maneuver. However, the presence of unrelated objects and clutter on the workspace could slightly increase the difficulty by requiring careful navigation and precise manipulation to avoid unintended interactions.

        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npaligemma_fast_droid is a vision-language manipulation policy that can quickly generate purposeful motions and usually executes them with smooth, collision-free trajectories.  In head-to-head play it wins slightly more often than it loses, especially on single-object pick-and-place or push/knock tasks.  When instructions require only one grasp and one placement, the policy is often decisive and fast.  It remains, however, brittle to subtle language cues (colour words, negations, ordinal ordering) and to tasks that demand sequential reasoning, fine shape alignment (drawers, bottles, writing) or sustained grasp stability.  Episodes also show occasional freezes or early terminations, suggesting incomplete recovery behaviours.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\nOverall record (61 evaluated episodes)  \nWins: 31\u2003Losses: 16\u2003Ties: 14\u2003(\u2248 51 % win-rate)  \n\nKey comparative insights  \n\u2022 Dominates when the competing policy freezes or hesitates; 10 of its 31 wins were against an idle opponent (<ref>214e965c</ref>, <ref>84319d8a</ref>, <ref>0f4d8f93</ref>, <ref>379e00ab</ref>).  \n\u2022 Consistently better on straightforward single-object pick/place: red cube\u2192green bowl (<ref>189d9705</ref>), carrot\u2192yellow dish (<ref>7d90355d</ref>), tape\u2192red plate (<ref>3c07a309</ref>), black bottle\u2192blue bowl (<ref>03d8876b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Matches or loses when colour recognition or fine category selection is critical: chose wrong \u201cpurple\u201d object (<ref>c076f615</ref>), wrong non-red object (<ref>66134d40</ref>), mis-identified two pink items (<ref>8533296d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Multi-step or ordering tasks remain troublesome; tied or lost in \u201ctouch a book then the bear\u201d (<ref>4cdf7321</ref>) and \u201cput two pink objects next to each other\u201d (<ref>8533296d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Outperforms peers on dynamic push/knock actions: reliably removed cups (<ref>379e00ab</ref>) and completed \u201cknock the cup off\u201d faster than opponent.  \n\u2022 Drawer interaction is weaker than competitors: lost on \u201cmarker in drawer\u201d (<ref>4d49c628</ref>) and \u201cbowl in drawer\u201d (<ref>efa9835e</ref>).  \n\u2022 Shows superior recovery & incremental refinement during hanging, stacking or cloth manipulation: won \u201chang ring on pole\u201d (<ref>78c9a5c6</ref>) and \u201cput stapler on cloth\u201d (<ref>be31263b</ref>) by iteratively refining approach while rival took riskier single moves.  \n\u2022 When both agents attempt the same erroneous action, outcome often a tie (e.g., both failed to orient gripper horizontally <ref>3c14888e</ref>; both mis-knocked cup but not off table <ref>96c24f50</ref>).  \n\u2022 Tends to lose time-boxed races that need several grasps: froze after first item in multi-item sort, whereas rival completed more steps (<ref>00d2b265</ref>).  \n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Reliable, smooth grasp-and-place motions for isolated rigid objects; minimal jitter in wins such as red cube\u2192green bowl (<ref>189d9705</ref>) and pineapple pick-up (<ref>5b10c3c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Effective pushing/knocking behaviours; clean lateral sweep knocked cup entirely off surface while rival meandered (<ref>379e00ab</ref>).  \n\u2022 Good robustness to dim lighting or glare\u2014still picked the red box under poor illumination (<ref>214e965c</ref>) and operated in dark scene placing bear on books (tie but no vision failure, <ref>2e1d844d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Incremental correction: makes second and third attempts instead of aborting; succeeded on third try with red box (<ref>214e965c</ref>) and adjusted orientation while hanging ring (<ref>78c9a5c6</ref>).  \n\u2022 Cautious collision avoidance; avoids sweeping through clutter \u2014 evident in stapler-to-cloth win (<ref>be31263b</ref>) where rival bumped distractors.  \n\u2022 Capable of simple cloth/towel manipulation; folded towel faster than opponent (<ref>5e8fff1a</ref>) and covered bowl successfully (<ref>8e68d786</ref>).  \n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Colour / attribute confusions: picked orange object when told \u201cpurple\u201d (<ref>c076f615</ref>), red block for \u201cnon-red\u201d (<ref>66134d40</ref>), ignored pink adjacency requirement (<ref>8533296d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Frequent grasp-drop events: repeatedly lost grip on marker in drawer task (<ref>4d49c628</ref>) and spoon drop before placement (<ref>41a8d01d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Drawer and enclosure manipulation underperforms; wrong drawer target (<ref>375f5419</ref>) or premature release on bowl-in-drawer (<ref>efa9835e</ref>).  \n\u2022 Multi-step sequencing lapses (order or repetition): failed second step \u201ctouch bear after book\u201d (<ref>4cdf7321</ref>) and only moved first item in \u201cplace all items\u201d task (<ref>08d3d301</ref>).  \n\u2022 Occasional complete inactivity / freeze yielding ties or losses (<ref>6dbe79b9</ref>, <ref>52a8cd8a40</ref>).  \n\u2022 Limited fine alignment for narrow openings: banana into bottle loss (<ref>47b5e345</ref>) and repeated failure to release plant into bowl (<ref>fe57eae1</ref>).  \n\n5. Instruction Following  \nThe policy usually parses straightforward imperative sentences but struggles with:  \n\u2022 Negations or exclusivity: knocked teddy instead of frog while instruction said \u201cnothing else\u201d (<ref>cd3628b2</ref>).  \n\u2022 Relational qualifiers (\u201cnext to each other\u201d, <ref>8533296d</ref>) and sequential phrases (\u201cthen\u201d, <ref>4cdf7321</ref>).  \n\u2022 Colour adjectives mismatch as noted above.  \n\u2022 Typo tolerance is moderate: succeeded despite \u201cpalce\u201d typo (<ref>4f26d14f</ref>) and \u201ccomppleknock\u201d (<ref>96c24f50</ref>) but failed on ambiguous \u201cnon-read\u201d (<ref>66134d40</ref>).  \n\u2022 Handles polite modifiers or superfluous words gracefully (\u201cplease\u201d in cat-book task, <ref>3a37e56d</ref>).  \n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning strength: correctly inferred that tilting banana lets it fit inside bottle and outperformed rival in similar scenario (<ref>8c55a6ce</ref>).  It also identified \u201cdifferent object among three\u201d conceptually, though grasped wrong item (<ref>4f26d14f</ref>) indicating partial but imperfect categorical reasoning.  \nLanguage reasoning weakness: mis-interpreted \u201call red items\u201d by stopping after first item (<ref>00d2b265</ref>) and failed to derive \u201cnon-red\u201d set complement (<ref>66134d40</ref>).  \nSpatial reasoning is acceptable\u2014navigated cluttered office scenes, avoided shelves when picking stapler (<ref>be31263b</ref>)\u2014but mis-located plant shelf level (<ref>d49dcce7</ref>).  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Grasping: firm on rectangular or cylindrical objects (marker, bottle, spoon).  Soft toys and thin sheets are less reliable.  \n\u2022 Placing/stacking: accurate for bowls/plates (<ref>3c07a309</ref>, <ref>189d9705</ref>).  Mis-aligned narrow mouths (bottle) and drawer inserts.  \n\u2022 Pushing/knocking: decisive sweep actions (cups, frog attempts).  \n\u2022 Insertion/hanging: successful ring-on-pole (<ref>78c9a5c6</ref>); limited success inserting banana in bottle.  \n\u2022 Cloth manipulation: basic folding and covering executed.  \n\u2022 Recovery: often retries after failed grasp; however, recovery time can cause timeouts in long tasks (<ref>08d3d301</ref>).  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \nHandles dim light (<ref>214e965c</ref>), glare (<ref>9c2b29f5</ref>) and cluttered desks (office supply episodes) with little degradation.  Performance degrades with occlusions that hide target from wrist camera (e.g., pineapple partly behind cup still grasped <ref>5b10c3c</ref>, but drawer marker partially occluded caused drops <ref>4d49c628</ref>).  Camera angle bias is evident: tasks where wrist view misses target (plant on bookshelf, <ref>d49dcce7</ref>) often fail.  \n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Colour or class confusion \u2192 wrong object grasp (<ref>c076f615</ref>, <ref>66134d40</ref>).  \n\u2022 Drops immediately after lift or before placement (<ref>4d49c628</ref>, <ref>41a8d01d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Freezing / no action leading to tie (<ref>6dbe79b9</ref>, <ref>52a8cd8a40</ref>).  \n\u2022 Overshooting or collision with furniture (cabinet collision during plant task, <ref>fe57eae1</ref>).  \n\u2022 Half-finished multi-step tasks\u2014completes first sub-goal then stops (<ref>08d3d301</ref>).  \n\u2022 Repeated but mis-aligned attempts without adaptive adjustment (releasing plant, <ref>fe57eae1</ref>; pushing cup but not off table, <ref>96c24f50</ref>).",
        "summary": "- Comparative Performance: ~51 % win-rate over 61 trials; dominant on simple single-object pick-place and push/knock, capitalises on opponent freezes, but loses or ties when colour discrimination, drawer insertion, or multi-step ordering are required; slower in multi-item time-boxed races.  \n\n- Strengths: Smooth, collision-free trajectories; reliable rigid-object grasp-place; decisive lateral pushes; tolerates dim lighting/glare; iterative refinement and safe recovery; cautious around clutter; basic cloth folding and hanging succeed.  \n\n- Weaknesses: Frequent colour/attribute confusions, grip drops, and freezes; weak at drawer/enclosure manipulation, narrow insertions, and fine alignment; sequence execution often halts after first sub-goal.  \n\n- Instruction Following: Parses plain imperatives well; struggles with negations, relational terms, ordering words (\u201cthen\u201d), and colour adjectives; moderate typo robustness; ignores polite fillers without issue.  \n\n- Reasoning: Adequate spatial and scene reasoning (tilting, obstacle avoidance); partial categorical reasoning; poor set-complement or \u201call items\u201d logic; occasional mis-localisation of shelf/level.  \n\n- Manipulation Skills: Strong grasps on rectangular/cylindrical objects, accurate bowl/plate placement, effective sweeping pushes; partial success with ring hanging and bottle insertion; basic cloth tasks; retries help but can cause timeouts.  \n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Little degradation in low light, glare, or clutter; performance drops with target occlusions or when wrist camera misses object, revealing camera-angle sensitivity.  \n\n- Common Failure Modes: Wrong object chosen (colour/class mix-up), object dropped mid-transfer, complete inactivity, collisions with furniture, stopping after first step of multi-goal tasks, repeated mis-aligned attempts without adjustment.",

Both views clearly show the carrot, the yellow dish, and the surrounding objects, providing sufficient visual information for the robot to execute the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or complicate the task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick the carrot and place it in the yellow dish\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There is no ambiguity regarding the objects involved or the intended action.\n\nScene: The scene is simple and organized, with minimal clutter. The carrot is clearly visible, placed vertically in a red holder, and the yellow dish is unobstructed and easily accessible. Other objects, such as cups and a plush toy, are present but do not significantly interfere with the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The carrot is clearly visible, upright, and easily graspable, and the yellow dish is clearly identifiable and accessible. The straightforward setup and clear visibility of objects suggest minimal difficulty in executing the task.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_fast_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Policy A was frozen in place throughout the rollout.

            "Session ID: 4430675d-f714-481d-93da-0a170a469c04\nTask: pick the spoon and place it in the silver bowl\n\nScene Setup and Task Analysis\nCamera angle: The provided images include a clear top-down view from the robot's wrist camera and a third-person angled view. Both angles clearly show the objects on the table, providing sufficient visibility of the spoon, bowls, and other items necessary for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is adequate, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or make the task difficult to observe or complete.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick the spoon and place it in the silver bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It is straightforward and leaves no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a wooden table with several objects placed on it, including a pink spoon, a silver bowl containing colorful objects, a yellow bowl, a purple cup, and two additional cups. The spoon is clearly visible and easily accessible. The silver bowl is also clearly visible, although it currently contains other small objects, which could potentially interfere slightly with placing the spoon inside. The other objects on the table are spaced apart and do not significantly clutter or obstruct the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The spoon is clearly visible, well-oriented, and easily accessible. The silver bowl is also clearly visible and within reach. The only minor difficulty could be the presence of other small objects already inside the silver bowl, which might require some precision to place the spoon without disturbing them. Overall, the task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making it straightforward to complete.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_fast_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_fast_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Policy A solved the task halfway through while policy B remained still without any reasonable behavior."

        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npaligemma_fast_specialist_droid is a vision-language manipulation policy that generally reacts quickly, forms smooth, direct trajectories, and can grasp medium-size rigid objects with reasonable reliability. When the scene is simple and the command is a single pick-and-place, the policy usually makes at least partial progress. Conversely, it often freezes or stops prematurely, and struggles with fine-motor subtasks such as releasing, pouring, folding or orienting objects precisely. The controller rarely performs explicit recovery once it makes an error, and it has difficulty honoring \u201cdo nothing\u201d or negated instructions.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\nOverall head-to-head record across the 56 evaluated episodes:  \nWins 24\u2002|\u2002Losses 13\u2002|\u2002Ties 19  \n\nCategory trends (relative to the opponent):  \n\u2022 Simple pick / pick-and-place: 15-4 win-loss (e.g., carrot, frog, cup)  \n\u2022 Drawer / door interaction: 4-4-3 (mixed)  \n\u2022 Pouring, folding, hanging, multi-step: 2-5 loss-skewed  \n\u2022 Passive / negated commands: 0-2 (always tied or lost)  \n\nEpisode-level comparison highlights  \n\u2013 Outperformed the competitor on several low-clutter pick tasks by executing the first successful grasp (carrot <ref>785d31f2-c30b-4a66-989f-6e259ed6ea63</ref>, green bowl <ref>c53bcbf0-c324-4e28-b342-761a0ac4a31c</ref>, blue cup <ref>1f595450-e0bc-47b8-b70c-650849115eb3</ref>).  \n\u2013 Frequently beat the baseline by choosing the correct object while the rival selected a distractor (stapler vs. pen <ref>559e048f-acf7-4225-bb64-1cd903970a38</ref>, stapler vs. bowl <ref>6f1b35b4-f641-448d-9b20-153c1cc11f99</ref>, plant task where the rival never left home-pose <ref>d49dcce7-3510-482d-ba06-0cbccb0b1d79</ref>).  \n\u2013 Lost whenever the task required inactivity or explicit negation; it moved on \u201cdo not move\u201d (<ref>70d3d182-d4fd-405a-ac2b-5476e575195c</ref>) and tried to act when told \u201cif there is no frog, do nothing\u201d (<ref>2e1549d3-8eb4-464c-90ce-9300925622f0</ref>).  \n\u2013 Precision placement and release is a frequent differentiator. It grasped the purple plum but never released it into the bowl, costing the match (<ref>0b76325d-fba2-429e-9b83-ead0d22722b4</ref>); similarly left the stapler on a bowl instead of the book (<ref>6f1b35b4-f641-448d-9b20-153c1cc11f99</ref>).  \n\u2013 Drawer/door manipulation showed mixed results: one clear win (pull door <ref>2176fbf7-5de1-4ff4-b92a-f0ad36c26df2</ref>), two outright losses where the rival fully closed the drawer (<ref>ab7ae88f-750b-4166-91de-6c9a4443f96f</ref>, <ref>28f37798-fb92-46ee-b137-08d1125412ae</ref>), and several ties where neither policy reached the handle (<ref>dac2ddf1-4ae3-443e-ab78-59dfabe43f63</ref>).  \n\u2013 In pouring-type tasks, both policies were weak, but paligemma spilled fewer nuts than its opponent yet still lost because the rival actually hit the plate (<ref>7f924418-7d2a-43ba-a3d6-024065acbc9a</ref>).  \n\u2013 Handling transparent or reflective targets (plastic cup, test tube) resulted in marginal wins where both failed but paligemma explored more (<ref>47312494-7185-40a8-9162-9a5812fc9b21</ref>).  \nKey insights  \n\u2022 Relative strength is highest when the objective is \u201cidentify one colored object and lift it.\u201d  \n\u2022 The policy gains competitive advantage by moving earlier; opponents that hesitate are often beaten on speed.  \n\u2022 It rarely corrects the final placement\u2014once contact occurs, it opens the gripper or stops, while some baselines perform micro-adjustments.  \n\u2022 Negative or passive instructions systematically trip the model and usually erase its speed advantage.  \n\u2022 Fine-manipulation and multi-step sequences (pour, hang, fold, uncap) remain open weaknesses against better-calibrated baselines.\n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Fast, direct reach trajectories that beat slower rivals to the object (carrot task <ref>785d31f2-c30b-4a66-989f-6e259ed6ea63</ref>).  \n\u2022 Consistently recognizes color cues\u2014picked correct green bowl while opponent only touched it <ref>c53bcbf0-c324-4e28-b342-761a0ac4a31c</ref>.  \n\u2022 Maintains stable grasps on common rigid objects (battery, blue cup, stapler) even under dim lighting <ref>95c9a9ef-6a51-4894-bac5-4d2e1c6624bc</ref>, <ref>1f595450-e0bc-47b8-b70c-650849115eb3</ref>.  \n\u2022 Shows occasional corrective probing near the target when grasp is uncertain, giving it narrow wins in clutter (<ref>47312494-7185-40a8-9162-9a5812fc9b21</ref>).  \n\u2022 Able to open-space navigation\u2014accurately moved to bookshelf height while rival stayed idle <ref>d49dcce7-3510-482d-ba06-0cbccb0b1d79</ref>.\n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Freezes for entire episode (red box pick-up <ref>214e965c-cfe4-418b-8f88-41ee94939fe4</ref>, basket cup task <ref>28f37798-fb92-46ee-b137-08d1125412ae</ref>).  \n\u2022 Fails release/placement step: holds object above goal then stops (plum above bowl <ref>0b76325d-fba2-429e-9b83-ead0d22722b4</ref>, stapler on wrong surface <ref>6f1b35b4-f641-448d-9b20-153c1cc11f99</ref>).  \n\u2022 Picks distractor items of similar shape or color (purple marker instead of green <ref>b9cf4b59-5a13-4347-aeab-3a6f469d7d54</ref>, pineapple before duck <ref>f2323137-dcee-4b47-978c-969e420c661b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Repeatedly violates \u201cdo not move\u201d or \u201cif absent, do nothing\u201d rules <ref>70d3d182-d4fd-405a-ac2b-5476e575195c</ref>, <ref>2e1549d3-8eb4-464c-90ce-9300925622f0</ref>.  \n\u2022 Poor at precision tasks\u2014spills contents while pouring (<ref>7f924418-7d2a-43ba-a3d6-024065acbc9a</ref>), cannot fold towel (<ref>5e8fff1a-1b89-4e75-abbf-7abc20d6b217</ref>), fails to hang ring (<ref>78c9a5c6-b24e-4ec5-a84d-9efa31c9f0a9</ref>).  \n\u2022 Limited recovery: once the first attempt fails it seldom retries (green frog out of bowl <ref>37778af3-2b6c-4b66-a28c-c8c0ec08b481</ref>).\n\n5. Instruction Following  \nSuccesses: Handles straightforward \u201cpick X\u201d or \u201cplace X in Y\u201d commands with reliable color/shape parsing (<ref>559e048f-acf7-4225-bb64-1cd903970a38</ref>, <ref>18263a5f-ce86-4cc4-a828-ee194a3895d6</ref>). Misunderstandings:  \n\u2022 Negated or passive directives\u2014acted instead of remaining still (<ref>70d3d182-d4fd-405a-ac2b-5476e575195c</ref>).  \n\u2022 Relational placement \u201cto the left of\u201d executed but left object slightly mis-aligned (<ref>dd4c3c4f-27d7-4c61-af76-69bf6608ad0d</ref>).  \n\u2022 Disregards counting/ordinal words: \u201csecond drawer\u201d treated same as \u201cany drawer\u201d (<ref>dac2ddf1-4ae3-443e-ab78-59dfabe43f63</ref>).  \n\u2022 Robust to minor typos (\u201cput the bowl in the towl\u201d)\u2014understood intent albeit lost due to placement error <ref>8807b50e-01b1-4f49-8931-395b48e2224d</ref>.  \n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning: correct object disambiguation in cluttered scenes (purple plate among many utensils <ref>c63f325f-6678-48f9-95ec-1e02b11a2733</ref>); but fails when multiple identical categories exist\u2014picks pineapple before duck <ref>f2323137-dcee-4b47-978c-969e420c661b</ref>.  \nText reasoning: handles conjunctions (\u201cpick up duck and place into bowl\u201d <ref>f2323137-dcee-4b47-978c-969e420c661b</ref>) yet cannot parse conditionals (\u201cif there is no frog, do nothing\u201d <ref>2e1549d3-8eb4-464c-90ce-9300925622f0</ref>).

        "full_report": "1. Policy Overview  \npaligemma_vq_droid exhibits a generally decisive and brisk motion strategy: it often initiates a reach within the first few seconds and can complete short pick-and-place trajectories cleanly.  When geometry is simple and the target object is visually salient, the policy is competitive and sometimes superior.  However, its behaviour is brittle: it mis-classifies objects that differ subtly from distractors, stops part-way through motions, and frequently omits the final release.  These weaknesses lead to a roughly balanced win/loss record rather than clear dominance.\n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\nOverall head-to-head record across 49 episodes  \nWins: 17\u2003Losses: 16\u2003Ties: 16  \n(Win rate \u2248 35 %, Loss rate \u2248 33 %)\n\nTask classes where the policy usually prevails  \n\u2022 Simple container insertion or drawer placement (blue-cup-in-mug, bowl-in-drawer, cable unplug)  \n\u2022 \u201cPush/knock\u201d interactions with a single salient target (knock bear, touch red box)  \nTask classes where it is often outperformed  \n\u2022 Fine categorical discrimination (multiple books, markers vs pens, similar bowls)  \n\u2022 Multi-step pick-and-drop that requires a precise final release (ball-in-bin, red bottle-to-bowl)\n\nEpisode-level comparative insights  \n\u2022 Decisive early motion often beats slow or idle competitors: the policy won because it moved first in episodes touching the red box <ref>d80e7555-39aa-44e3-8858-333a5034b07b</ref>, finding the fruit <ref>9c7734f2-1eb4-408e-bc3e-bb07a4f3c757</ref> and unplugging a cable <ref>ff717942-5d20-421c-b1a5-e4ebc4876a53</ref>.  \n\u2022 On easy single-object insertions it cleanly succeeded while rivals failed (blue cup \u2192 mug <ref>d8a69e9b-a82c-4096-93a3-013f922a4dac</ref>, brown bowl \u2192 drawer <ref>375f5419-ea96-4613-b5d1-800c9738a5be</ref>).  \n\u2022 Several \u201cwins\u201d were relative rather than absolute: it dropped the sponge on the table yet still beat an idle opponent <ref>6d0b94cd-d502-45c6-bd24-3f0387542588</ref>, and placed the fork only part-way to the napkin but outperformed a stationary rival <ref>5973ab15-b6d5-4c70-813e-b3a759b282b9</ref>.  \n\u2022 The policy consistently loses when the competitor correctly identifies a subtle target: wrong book <ref>13e10649-3ae9-45e8-995b-42a1cb27280c</ref>, pen vs stapler <ref>559e048f-acf7-4225-bb64-1cd903970a38</ref>, frog pick-up <ref>f2ef5ad7-bb6d-42f6-97c7-d096449abd31</ref>.  \n\u2022 Poor grasp height or premature closure caused failures where the rival completed the lift (carrot to bowl <ref>785d31f2-c30b-4a66-989f-6e259ed6ea63</ref>, red bottle to bowl <ref>8d7315ac-400b-4de0-81bb-6e2697d06000</ref>).  \n\u2022 Freezing mid-trajectory made it lose despite an initially correct approach (pineapple task <ref>bcae556a-6884-4f8c-a5e9-8f8ad2b11aa7</ref>, water-jar closing <ref>468317b5-1146-46ed-b52c-e1f634972279</ref>).  \n\u2022 In cluttered scenes competitors benefitted from more reliable object selection (towel-to-blue-bowl <ref>a65a52a6-ecf7-47f7-9805-18bef9f45d80</ref>, purple plate \u2192 basket <ref>c63f325f-6678-48f9-95ec-1e02b11a2733</ref>).  \n\u2022 Both policies frequently tie on ambiguous or poorly specified instructions, each doing little (missing object name <ref>5cea1a60-a992-420c-b919-bc2183b2d2f6</ref>, clipper-into-jar <ref>ec48cfe0-232c-4a50-8d89-e09f0c13aef3</ref>).  \n\nKey take-aways  \n\u2013 Early motion gives paligemma short-term advantages, but quality of finalization is lower than many rivals.  \n\u2013 It is comparatively strong on geometric placement but weak on fine semantic selection.  \n\u2013 Competitors catch up whenever grasp robustness or final release precision is required.  \n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Fast reaction time frequently secures partial credit before rivals move <ref>d80e7555-39aa-44e3-8858-333a5034b07b</ref><ref>6a0008d0-5ba2-44b8-8918-4ef3a3e58dbb</ref>.  \n\u2022 Container insertion succeeds when the receptacle is large and centrally located (blue cup \u2192 mug <ref>d8a69e9b-a82c-4096-93a3-013f922a4dac</ref>, bowl \u2192 drawer <ref>375f5419-ea96-4613-b5d1-800c9738a5be</ref>).  \n\u2022 Able to execute pushing tasks cleanly without disturbing non-targets (knock bear <ref>041ac340-d55c-4239-b3f9-f1b4ada86095</ref>).  \n\u2022 Demonstrates precise line-of-action grasps on thin objects (black plug extraction <ref>ff717942-5d20-421c-b1a5-e4ebc4876a53</ref>).  \n\u2022 Reasonable recovery through re-grasping when first placement is unstable (re-grasp of cup inside mug <ref>d8a69e9b-a82c-4096-93a3-013f922a4dac</ref>).  \n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Frequent object confusion in the presence of similar distractors: pen vs stapler <ref>559e048f-acf7-4225-bb64-1cd903970a38</ref>, wrong book <ref>13e10649-3ae9-45e8-995b-42a1cb27280c</ref>, wrong marker <ref>8554b6d5-a88d-48ad-945f-ff22a81ce00f</ref>.  \n\u2022 Incomplete task finalization\u2014object never released or falls outside target (sponge dropped short <ref>6d0b94cd-d502-45c6-bd24-3f0387542588</ref>, plum not released in bowl <ref>0b76325d-fba2-429e-9b83-ead0d22722b4</ref>).  \n\u2022 Episodes of total inactivity or freeze despite clear instruction (pineapple pick-and-place <ref>bcae556a-6884-4f8c-a5e9-8f8ad2b11aa7</ref>, water-jar closing <ref>468317b5-1146-46ed-b52c-e1f634972279</ref>).  \n\u2022 Poor height estimation: gripper stays too high, leading to missed grasps (carrot <ref>785d31f2-c30b-4a66-989f-6e259ed6ea63</ref>, red bottle <ref>8d7315ac-400b-4de0-81bb-6e2697d06000</ref>).  \n\u2022 Susceptible to collisions or pushing objects away when approaching from awkward angles (compartment box collision <ref>b4108050-ea8c-42bf-9c47-0a1f9670d959</ref>).  \n\n5. Instruction Following  \n\u2022 Accurately handles direct, unambiguous commands (blue cup in mug <ref>d8a69e9b-a82c-4096-93a3-013f922a4dac</ref>, unplug black cable <ref>ff717942-5d20-421c-b1a5-e4ebc4876a53</ref>).  \n\u2022 Fails when linguistic cues require fine category selection\u2014confuses \u201cbook with flower\u201d <ref>13e10649-3ae9-45e8-995b-42a1cb27280c</ref> or \u201cstapler\u201d vs \u201cpen\u201d <ref>559e048f-acf7-4225-bb64-1cd903970a38</ref>.  \n\u2022 Ambiguous or incomplete language leads to inactivity equal to competitor (missing object name in card task <ref>5cea1a60-a992-420c-b919-bc2183b2d2f6</ref>).  \n\u2022 Handles relational prepositions (\u201cinto\u201d, \u201con\u201d, \u201coff\u201d) reliably when the goal geometry is simple, as shown by correct knock-off <ref>041ac340-d55c-4239-b3f9-f1b4ada86095</ref>.  \n\u2022 No observable robustness to negation or typos\u2014such patterns were not present in the test set.  \n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene-level  \n\u2022 Positive: Distinguishes between two cables of different colours and selects the black one <ref>ff717942-5d20-421c-b1a5-e4ebc4876a53</ref>.  \n\u2022 Negative: Does not revise plan when wrist camera cannot see the target; stays static instead of exploring (pineapple task <ref>bcae556a-6884-4f8c-a5e9-8f8ad2b11aa7</ref>).  \n\nText-level  \n\u2022 Correctly infers multi-step goal \u201ctouch, but do not move\u201d and finishes faster than rival <ref>d80e7555-39aa-44e3-8858-333a5034b07b</ref>.  \n\u2022 Struggles with attribute disambiguation (multiple coloured books <ref>13e10649-3ae9-45e8-995b-42a1cb27280c</ref>).  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \n\u2022 Reliable power grasps on rigid objects such as cups, bowls, plugs (cup insertion <ref>d8a69e9b-a82c-4096-93a3-013f922a4dac</ref>, drawer placement <ref>375f5419-ea96-4613-b5d1-800c9738a5be</ref>).  \n\u2022 Placement precision adequate for large receptacles but poor for small or narrow targets (banana thrown off grid <ref>47b5e345-1a8c-40dc-b4ef-da6ebfc37960</ref>, ball missed bin <ref>7d574986-89eb-4b33-a624-a17903b1baf0</ref>).  \n\u2022 Limited compliance\u2014soft items like towel or sponge often slip or are dropped early <ref>a65a52a6-ecf7-47f7-9805-18bef9f45d80</ref><ref>6d0b94cd-d502-45c6-bd24-3f0387542588</ref>.  \n\u2022 Occasional re-grasp behaviour indicates some corrective planning capability <ref>d8a69e9b-a82c-4096-93a3-013f922a4dac</ref>.  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \n\u2022 Lighting changes (office vs lab) do not noticeably degrade performance; no light-related failures observed.  \n\u2022 Performance drops in heavy clutter\u2014fails to isolate purple plate among many objects <ref>c63f325f-6678-48f9-95ec-1e02b11a2733</ref> and ignores clipper in messy workspace <ref>ec48cfe0-232c-4a50-8d89-e09f0c13aef3</ref>.  \n\u2022 Camera occlusion of target (wrist view hiding frog) leads to mis-grasp while competitor compensates <ref>f2ef5ad7-bb6d-42f6-97c7-d096449abd31</ref>.  \n\u2022 Able to generalise to shelf-level manipulation, albeit inefficiently (plant on bookshelf <ref>f80985e2-fda2-40c8-9a1c-e84e26693ceb</ref>).  \n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Idling/freezing after an initial reach, causing time-outs <ref>bcae556a-6884-4f8c-a5e9-8f8ad2b11aa7</ref><ref>468317b5-1146-46ed-b52c-e1f634972279</ref>.  \n\u2022 Selecting a colour-similar distractor (pen, towel, cup) instead of the goal <ref>559e048f-acf7-4225-bb64-1cd903970a38</ref><ref>8554b6d5-a88d-48ad-945f-ff22a81ce00f</ref>.  \n\u2022 Gripper positioned too high, resulting in missed grasp or object slipping <ref>785d31f2-c30b-4a66-989f-6e259ed6ea63</ref>.  \n\u2022 Forgetting to open gripper for release even after correct transport <ref>0b76325d-fba2-429e-9b83-ead0d22722b4</ref>.  \n\u2022 Pushing items aside or colliding with scene geometry during descent <ref>b4108050-ea8c-42bf-9c47-0a1f9670d959</ref>.  \n\nThis analysis suggests that paligemma_vq_droid is competitive when tasks are visually clear and geometrically simple, but it lags behind peers on object-specific reasoning, fine discrimination, and task completion reliability.",
        "summary": "- Comparative Performance: ~35 % win, ~33 % loss; fast early motion wins simple insert or push tasks, but policy loses when fine object discrimination, robust grasping, or precise release are required; several victories are partial successes against idle rivals.  \n\n- Strengths: Very rapid reaction; reliable power grasps and large-receptacle insertions; clean single-axis pushes; occasional corrective re-grasping; early decisive moves often secure score before competitors act.  \n\n- Weaknesses: Frequent confusion among similar objects, incomplete task finalization (no release or dropped short), occasional total inactivity, poor height estimation, and collisions on awkward approaches.  \n\n- Instruction Following: Executes clear, direct commands and simple spatial prepositions well; falters on fine attribute or category distinctions; ambiguity yields idling; no evidence of robustness to negation or typos.  \n\n- Reasoning: Can pick between obviously different objects and deduce simple multi-step goals, but lacks replanning when vision fails and struggles with subtle attribute reasoning.  \n\n- Manipulation Skills: Strong rigid-object power grasps; placement accurate for large targets but misses small/narrow ones; limited compliance with soft items; sporadic but present re-grasp corrections.  \n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Lighting changes tolerated; heavy clutter and camera occlusions sharply reduce performance; some generalization to new shelf layouts but with inefficiency.  \n\n- Common Failure Modes: Mid-trajectory freezing/time-outs, selecting colour-similar distractors, gripper too high causing missed grasps, forgetting to open gripper on release, and collisions that displace objects.",

The top-down view clearly shows the robot's gripper and the objects directly beneath it, but the red box mentioned in the task description is not clearly visible or identifiable in either image. The third-person view provides a broader perspective of the environment but also does not clearly show the red box, making it difficult to determine the exact location or presence of the target object.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the workspace and objects. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"just touch the red box and nothing else\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the robot's objective. However, the red box itself is not clearly visible or identifiable in the provided images, introducing ambiguity regarding the exact target object.\n\nScene: The scene setup includes a perforated black table surface with several objects placed on one side, including a stuffed animal, cardboard boxes, and a cloth. These objects could serve as distractors or obstacles. The described red box is not clearly visible in the provided images, making it difficult to determine its orientation, visibility, or accessibility. The presence of multiple unrelated objects could potentially interfere with the robot's ability to precisely identify and touch only the red box.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately difficult due to the ambiguity regarding the location and visibility of the red box. Although the task itself (touching a single object) is straightforward, the unclear presence and position of the target object, combined with the presence of distractors, increase the complexity. The robot would need to accurately identify the red box among other objects and carefully avoid touching anything else, requiring precise perception and controlled movement.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_vq_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_vq_droid won\nEvaluation notes: policy A tries to touch the red box but takes a long time to do anything and ends up failing by touching the green frog first. Policy B goes sstraight for the red box and knocks it over but fails in that it touches other items. Policy B was much more decisive and quicker while Policy A was testing my patience.",

The third-person view clearly shows the brown bear placed on top of a box, providing a good perspective of the environment and the relative position of the objects. The top-down view from the wrist camera, however, does not clearly show the bear, making it difficult to precisely determine the bear's exact position from the robot's perspective.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient overall, with no significant shadows or glares that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task. The objects and environment are clearly visible, and the lighting conditions appear consistent and adequate for task execution.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"knock the brown bear off the box\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. There is no ambiguity regarding the objective, and the description clearly specifies the target object (brown bear) and the action required (knock off the box).\n\nScene: The scene setup is relatively simple and uncluttered. The primary objects involved are the brown bear and the box it is placed upon. There are a few additional objects, such as papers or cards, placed on the table, but they do not significantly interfere with the task. The bear is clearly visible and positioned near the edge of the box, making it accessible for manipulation.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. While the bear is clearly visible and positioned conveniently near the edge of the box, the wrist camera's top-down view does not clearly show the bear, potentially complicating precise positioning and manipulation. However, the simplicity of the scene and the clear third-person view mitigate some of these challenges, making the task achievable with moderate precision and control.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_vq_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_vq_droid won\nEvaluation notes: both policies immediately knocked the brown bear but policy A just focused on the brown bear while policy B knocked the entire box.

Policy Overview  \npaligemma_diffusion_droid is a vision-language manipulation policy that produces generally smooth, collision-free arm motions and can complete many single-step pick-and-place or push tasks when the target object is unambiguous and well lit. It shows partial scene understanding, can operate amid moderate clutter, and occasionally recovers from initial mis-grasps. However, it is still brittle: colour recognition is imperfect, it often stops short of the final placement, and it struggles with purely verbal conditions (\u201cdo not move\u201d) or fine manipulation such as releasing inside a tight receptacle.  \n\n2. Comparative Performance  \n\u2022 Aggregate record across the 51 evaluated episodes: 19 wins \u2013 16 losses \u2013 16 ties.  \n\u2022 Strongest relative showings were on simple pick-and-place or push/knock tasks (e.g., pineapple into bowl, closing drawer), while it consistently lost to competitors on precision placements, colour-based selection, and passive/no-action instructions.  \n\nEpisode-level comparison highlights  \n\u2013 Outperformed the rival by completing the pick-and-place cleanly in straightforward scenes: pineapple \u2192 bowl <ref>bcae556a</ref>, frog out of bowl <ref>37778af3</ref>, red bottle \u2192 purple bowl <ref>d40e2c68</ref>.  \n\u2013 Equal performance (both poor) on \u201cdo nothing / stay still\u201d or orientation demands: failed to remain stationary <ref>70d3d182</ref> and to hold a horizontal pose <ref>3c14888e</ref>.  \n\u2013 Lost whenever the task required accurate colour ID or fine alignment: blue cup \u2192 mug <ref>d8a69e9b</ref>, black bottle \u2192 blue bowl <ref>03d8876b</ref>, unplug black cable <ref>ff717942</ref>.  \n\u2013 Competed well under moderate clutter: put marker in jar despite cables <ref>c5c9e0b7</ref>, closed water-jar lid amid desk objects <ref>468317b5</ref>.  \n\u2013 Frequently conceded when the rival executed a single decisive motion faster (touch the book <ref>aed7d0aa</ref>, pick clear cup only <ref>3ebe11bd</ref>, place rubber duck in mug <ref>fa3d9252</ref>).  \n\nKey Insights  \n\u2022 The policy\u2019s 79 % win-rate (11/14) on \u201cpick X, put into bowl/box/bin\u201d tasks suggests an advantage on basic, unconstrained placements.  \n\u2022 It lost 6 of 7 episodes that required recognising a specific colour among distractors, indicating weaker visual discrimination.  \n\u2022 Both contenders were equally poor on negated commands or passive goals, indicating this model has no distinct edge in language nuance.  \n\u2022 When containers are involved, it often grasps correctly but fails to release inside (plant into bowl required seven attempts to drop <ref>fe57eae1</ref>).  \n\u2022 Competitor policies tended to be faster; ties frequently arose because both froze or timed out. paligemma_diffusion_droid\u2019s slower deliberation sometimes cost wins (green bowl pick-up <ref>c53bcbf0</ref>).  \n\n3. Strengths  \n\u2022 Reliable gross motion planning: smooth, collision-free trajectories in wins such as pineapple transfer <ref>bcae556a</ref> and marker-to-jar <ref>c5c9e0b7</ref>.  \n\u2022 Can complete multi-object sequences after short exploration (stacking cups pyramid <ref>bbedead2</ref>).  \n\u2022 Maintains stable grasps on lightweight objects (green frog pick-up <ref>48d8ab7b</ref>; white cup to dustbin <ref>81f7c34b</ref>).  \n\u2022 Works amid moderate table clutter without excessive collisions (red bottle \u2192 purple bowl surrounded by other items <ref>d40e2c68</ref>).  \n\u2022 Drawer interaction proficiency: fully closed drawer where rival left it half-open <ref>ab7ae88f</ref>.  \n\n4. Weaknesses  \n\u2022 Colour and object-class confusion: picked red object instead of purple <ref>c076f615</ref>, grabbed nail-puller instead of stapler <ref>bb75fd74</ref>, chose transparent cup instead of small white cup <ref>39140ffa</ref>.  \n\u2022 Poor handling of passive or negated commands: moved when told \u201cdo not move\u201d <ref>70d3d182</ref> and failed to \u201cdo nothing if no frog\u201d <ref>2e1549d3</ref>.  \n\u2022 Frequently stops short of final placement or fails to release: plant never released in bowl <ref>fe57eae1</ref>, drawer only half-opened <ref>0a25f1d8</ref>.  \n\u2022 Fails fine motor tasks requiring precision alignment: could not place blue cup into mug <ref>d8a69e9b</ref> or black bottle on blue bowl <ref>03d8876b</ref>.  \n\u2022 Susceptible to distractors; reached for wrong object in cluttered office scenes (unplug task <ref>ff717942</ref>).  \n\n5. Instruction Following  \nThe model follows straightforward imperatives well but shows limited sensitivity to qualifiers, negations, or relational language. It ignored \u201cif no frog, do nothing\u201d and took action anyway <ref>2e1549d3</ref>, and moved despite \u201cdo not move\u201d <ref>70d3d182</ref>. It handled multi-word but direct commands like \u201cplace the rubber duck in the mug\u201d reasonably (though grasp quality suffered) <ref>fa3d9252</ref>. Ambiguous poorly-phrased inputs (\u201cPut the towel blue bowl\u201d) still triggered a plausible interpretation and partial success <ref>a65a52a6</ref>, indicating some robustness to grammar errors.  \n\n6. Reasoning  \nScene reasoning is mixed. The policy inferred hidden containment in \u201ctake the frog out of the bowl\u201d and executed correctly <ref>37778af3</ref>, but failed to reason that no frog existed in the scene <ref>2e1549d3</ref>. Spatial reasoning around drawers is adequate when the handle is obvious (<ref>ab7ae88f</ref>) but deficient for less salient furniture (<ref>5cf6a9aa</ref>). Text-goal reasoning falters when conditions involve colour matching or exclusion: mis-identifies purple, green, red in several losses.  \n\n7. Manipulation Skills  \nGrasping: Strong on medium-size, regular shapes (cups, bottles, plush frogs). Weak on thin or transparent items\u2014knocked over clear cup <ref>3ebe11bd</ref>.  \nPlacing / Inserting: Reliable into wide bowls/bins (<ref>d40e2c68</ref>, <ref>81f7c34b</ref>), but accuracy drops for small-mouth mugs (<ref>d8a69e9b</ref>).  \nStacking: Demonstrated basic stacking without collapse <ref>bbedead2</ref>.  \nKnocking / Pushing: Executed frog knock-off partially but not completely (<ref>cd3628b2</ref>); cup knock-off failed to clear table <ref>96c24f50</ref>.  \nTool interaction: Could not reliably unplug a cable <ref>ff717942</ref> or write with a marker (only placed it) <ref>7f017668</ref>.  \nRelease control: Multiple failures to let go after transport (plant episode <ref>fe57eae1</ref>).  \n\n8. Robustness to Scene Variations  \n\u2022 Lighting: Performs similarly in bright lab light and dim office light (spoon-on-chair task still approached target <ref>d17bcc85</ref>).  \n\u2022 Clutter: Moderate resilience; succeeded in cluttered desktop scenes (water-jar lid <ref>468317b5</ref>) but distractors increase mis-grasp probability (red stapler scene <ref>bb75fd74</ref>).  \n\u2022 Occlusion: Performance drops when wrist camera is blocked (green bowl pick-up failure <ref>c53bcbf0</ref>).  \n\u2022 Viewpoint: Handles third-person and wrist cameras interchangeably; no obvious view-specific failures.  \n\n9. Common Failure Modes  \n\u2022 Object-selection errors \u2013 reaches for similarly coloured or neighbouring item (<ref>bb75fd74</ref>, <ref>18263a5f</ref>).  \n\u2022 Early termination / freezing, leaving task half-done (<ref>0a25f1d8</ref>, <ref>468317b5</ref>).  \n\u2022 Failure to release gripper after successful transport (<ref>fe57eae1</ref>).  \n\u2022 Ignoring negation or \u201cdo nothing\u201d clauses (<ref>2e1549d3</ref>, <ref>70d3d182</ref>).  \n\u2022 Colour misclassification when several variants present (<ref>c076f615</ref>, <ref>2ef20f23</ref>).  \n\u2022 Insufficient force or distance when pushing/knocking (frog not fully off box <ref>cd3628b2</ref>, cup not off table <ref>96c24f50</ref>).",
        "summary": "- Comparative Performance: 19 \u2013 16 \u2013 16 overall; strong on basic pick-and-place and push tasks even in moderate clutter; loses most colour-conditioned, precision placement, and passive/no-action episodes; slower execution often turns potential wins into ties.  \n\n- Strengths: Smooth, collision-free motion plans; secure grasps on medium items; reliable bowl/bin placements and drawer operations; completes simple multi-object sequences; handles moderate clutter and lighting changes gracefully.  \n\n- Weaknesses: Frequent colour or object-class confusions; poor compliance with negated/passive commands; often halts short of goal or fails to release; struggles with fine alignment and is easily distracted in dense scenes.  \n\n- Instruction Following: Executes direct imperatives and tolerates grammatical noise, but shows limited sensitivity to qualifiers, negations, and conditional phrases; multi-step yet explicit commands generally succeed.  \n\n- Reasoning: Partial scene understanding\u2014infers containment and obvious drawer affordances\u2014but fails to reason about absent objects or colour-matching constraints; spatial deductions reliable only when cues are salient.  \n\n- Manipulation Skills: Solid grasps and placements into wide receptacles; accuracy drops for narrow mouths, transparent or thin objects; demonstrates basic stacking; pushing/knocking often under-powered; tool use and gripper release remain inconsistent.  \n\n- Robustness to Scene Variations: Performance largely stable across lighting and viewpoints; tolerates moderate clutter, though occlusions or heavy distractors increase mis-grasp and failure rates.  \n\n- Common Failure Modes: Wrong object/colour selection, premature freezing, failure to open gripper at destination, ignoring \u201cdo nothing\u201d instructions, and insufficient force during push/knock actions.",

The third-person view clearly shows the green frog placed on top of the brown box, providing a good perspective of the scene and the objects involved. The top-down view from the wrist camera also clearly shows the green frog and the box, although the robot's gripper partially obstructs the view. Overall, the camera angles sufficiently capture the necessary objects and environment for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is adequate, clearly illuminating the green frog, the brown box, and the surrounding environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"just knock off the green frog off the brown box and nothing else\" is clear and understandable. It explicitly states the object to manipulate (green frog), the action required (knock off), and the object to avoid disturbing (brown box). There are no spelling or grammatical mistakes, and the lowercase usage is consistent and does not affect clarity.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a brown cardboard box placed on a flat, perforated black surface. The green frog is clearly positioned on top of the box. There is a plush toy partially visible on the box, which could potentially act as a distractor or obstacle. However, the frog is clearly separated from this plush toy, making it possible to complete the task without interference. The scene is relatively uncluttered, with minimal distractions or unnecessary objects.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The green frog is clearly visible, well-positioned, and easily accessible on top of the box. The box is stable and large enough to avoid accidental displacement. The presence of the plush toy as a distractor slightly increases the difficulty, but it is positioned far enough from the frog to minimize interference. Overall, the task does not require highly precise or dexterous manipulation, making it straightforward to execute.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_diffusion_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_diffusion_droid won\nEvaluation notes: policy A actually knocked over the frog but failed to completely knock off the green frog off the box. on other hand, policy B completely failed by just knocking off the brown bear and didn't touch the green frog",

The top-down view clearly shows the workspace directly beneath the robot, but the green frog mentioned in the task description is not visible in either image. The third-person view provides additional context of the environment but also does not show the green frog. Thus, the camera angles provided do not clearly show the object necessary for executing the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting in both images is sufficient and evenly distributed, with no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder visibility or make the task harder to observe or complete.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"knock off the green frog. if there is no frog, do nothing.\" is clear and understandable. It is written in lowercase letters, but there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes. The instructions are straightforward and unambiguous.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a black pegboard surface with cardboard boxes placed centrally. There is no visible green frog in either image. The boxes and the small card-like object on the side do not appear to significantly clutter or distract from the task. However, the absence of the green frog, which is the primary object of interest, makes it impossible to carry out the task as described.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears difficult or impossible to complete based on the provided images, as the green frog is not visible in the scene. Without the presence of the target object, the robot cannot perform the instructed action.

The third-person views clearly show the pineapple and bowl, providing good spatial context and clear visibility of the objects and environment. The top-down view from the wrist camera is somewhat obstructed by the robot's gripper, partially blocking the view of the pineapple and bowl, making it slightly less clear for precise manipulation.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient overall, with no significant shadows or glares affecting visibility. The objects and workspace are clearly illuminated, making it easy to distinguish the pineapple and bowl. There are no dim areas or lighting issues that would hinder the robot's ability to perform the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"pick up the pineapple and place into the bowl\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the objects involved and the required action, leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected behavior.\n\nScene: The scene setup is simple and uncluttered, consisting of only two relevant objects: a pineapple and a bowl. Both objects are clearly visible, placed on a plain white surface, and there are no distractors or unnecessary clutter that could interfere with the task. The pineapple is positioned upright, making it easy to grasp, and the bowl is placed nearby, clearly accessible for placing the pineapple inside.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears relatively easy. The simplicity of the scene, clear visibility, good lighting, and straightforward object placement contribute to a low difficulty level. The pineapple is upright and easily graspable, and the bowl is conveniently positioned, requiring no complex or precise manipulation. The only minor challenge is the partial obstruction in the wrist camera view, but this is unlikely to significantly impact the task execution.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_diffusion_droid was Policy A\nResult: paligemma_diffusion_droid won\nEvaluation notes: Policy A performs smoothly pick and place, finished at ease.

However, the described purple object is not visible in the provided images, creating ambiguity regarding the target object's location and identity.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a wooden compartmentalized box placed on a white table, with a bowl clearly visible in one compartment. Several distractor objects, including an orange ball and a watermelon-shaped object, are present. The described purple object is not visible in any provided images, making it difficult to identify and locate the target object. The compartments and distractors may add complexity to the task.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears moderately difficult due to the ambiguity regarding the purple object's visibility and location. The presence of distractor objects and multiple compartments could further complicate the robot's ability to identify and grasp the correct object. However, the clear visibility of the bowl and adequate lighting conditions somewhat mitigate the difficulty. The main challenge is the unclear location and visibility of the purple object, which is essential for task completion.\n\nHead-to-Head Comparison\nPolicy A or B: paligemma_diffusion_droid was Policy B\nResult: paligemma_diffusion_droid tied\nEvaluation notes: Smooth pick and place motion, wrong color selected (picked red object instead of purple).",

The third-person views clearly show the overall environment, the position of the red stapler, and the sheet of paper. The top-down view clearly shows the sheet of paper but does not fully capture the stapler, making it slightly challenging to precisely determine the stapler's exact position relative to the paper from this angle alone.\n\nLighting: The lighting in the images is sufficient and evenly distributed, allowing clear visibility of the objects and environment. There are no significant shadows, glares, or dim areas that would hinder the robot's ability to observe or complete the task.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"put the red stapler on the sheet of paper\" is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. It explicitly states the object to manipulate (red stapler) and the target location (sheet of paper), leaving no ambiguity regarding the robot's expected action.\n\nScene: The scene is set on a countertop with several objects present, including the red stapler, a sheet of paper, a tape dispenser, a hole puncher, and other miscellaneous items. Although there are multiple objects, the red stapler and the sheet of paper are clearly visible and not obstructed or hidden. The stapler is placed near the paper, oriented in a way that should be easy for the robot to grasp. The additional objects present could potentially serve as distractors, but they are sufficiently spaced apart, reducing the likelihood of interference.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears to be of moderate difficulty. The stapler is clearly visible, well-oriented, and placed close to the paper, simplifying the grasping and placement actions. However, the presence of multiple other objects in the scene introduces potential distractors, requiring the robot to accurately identify and select the correct object.

Both views clearly show the workspace and the objects placed on the surface, providing sufficient visibility of the environment and objects relevant to the task.\n\nLighting: The lighting is generally sufficient, but there is a noticeable glare in the top-down view image, creating a bright reflection on the workspace surface. This glare slightly reduces visibility and could potentially make observation or precise manipulation more challenging.\n\nClarity of task: The task description \"do not move\" is clear and straightforward. There are no spelling or grammatical mistakes, and the lowercase formatting does not introduce ambiguity. The robot is clearly expected to remain stationary and not interact with any objects.\n\nScene: The scene consists of a workspace with a few distinct objects placed on a perforated surface. Objects include small square items with colored circular features, a small green toy, and a fuzzy object. The objects are spaced apart and clearly visible, with no significant clutter or distractors that would interfere with the robot's ability to remain stationary.\n\nDifficulty: The task appears very easy.
